The hardware is at an acceptable level for the mainstream already (even PSVR1 was acceptable.  This is the mainstream that owns Nintendo hardware after all.)


No content = no users = no content.


Facebook and Playstation VR are burning money to fund content, to try and kickstart things.  Facebook is also subsidising the Quest 2, to kickstart user base as well.


In the next few years we'll see these investments bear fruit as more Oculus and Playstation VR exclusive games start rolling out, which will snowball with more users, more content, etc.


PCVR will stay niche but will occupy a place similar to PC gaming at the moment.  Indies that can't break into curated stores, ports of console games that can be run at higher resolutions and framerates, and the occasional built-for-PC high end game.  This will build up momentum as consoles come and go, whilst PC users can keep their libraries and hardware over time.",82

There are a ton of flatscreen games that have solid VR support added by the community. The [Flatscreen to VR Discord Channel](https://discord.gg/BccsjertUk) has a ton of these games. Valheim, Risk of Rain 2, and plenty of other games have excellent VR conversions. 

S&Box is coming soon and VR support will work in the same gamemodes as flatscreen if the gamemode devs choose. S&Box is the successor to Garry's Mod and is on Source 2, which is going to be the best engine for VR content given that Valve designed it to work with VR and demonstrated its potential in Half Life Alyx. 

I think that AAA games in PCVR will either be produced by Valve directly or will be modes that AAA games add optionally, such as how Star Wars Squadrons has full VR support but is primarily marketed as a flatscreen game, same with Flight Sim. 

I don't see a company like Blizzard making Overwatch VR ground up for VR only. The only way that changes is if Valve starts dishing out cash to other companies similar to how Playstation and Oculus do it, but Valve is apparently not interested in doing this.",14

1. Few AAA developers
2. Smaller library of games
3. high bar of entry ie require a good PC

So first off there are few AAA develoeprs sure we got Half Life Alyx, Fallout and MoH.  But that's about it.  The bulk of new games that come out are from indie games and while there are some great games that come by indie devlopers they dont' compete with Half Life Alyx.

Next small library of games.   Let's say I want to play a FPS.  On flat screen I have a ton of games to choose from.   I can pick and choose from genre, art style, story and so fourth.  Odds are I can find something that will fit what ever I crave.

With VR not so much.  Sure there are some but no where near the volume of FPS out there.  Once I play Half Life Alyx there isn't much more I could go to... i guess boneworks but nothing on the same level.

Same thing could be said about RTS.  On PC i have my choice of any number of RTS.  In VR.... yeah... there's a handful at best.  


Honestly I'm hard pressed to find 1 single genre that VR has a plethora of.   


As for your example when it comes to RPGs  Fallout and Skyrim aren't the same type of RPG as a table top simulator.     Sure they are all RPGS but not nearly the same experience.   

Finally is PC requirements.   It's a pretty big bar for entry.   Obviously it doesn't help now it's impossible to build a new PC.   But assuming it wasn't you would need what at least a 1070.    According to steam the most common card is still  1060 followed by a 1050 and that's not going to cut it.

So that means developers aren't going to spend as much money or time doing VR games.  Although hopefully this will change seeing as how many new people Occulus has brought to VR.

To really bring more people to VR you need to make more big AAA games for it or that are at least compatible with it like Fallout VR or Star Wars Squadrons.    Sure  a game like Outer Wilds or Beatsaber are fun but you need more large scale games that will keep people playing for hours on end.",1

If you for example just enjoy various experience in VR, there is tons of content. If you need JRPG's and only JRPG's, then VR isn't the right platform to ever use. 

And for FPS you already have fantastic titles like Pavlov, Onward, Walking Dead, Super Hot, Population One and many more. All fully fleshed out and amazing games worth tons of hours of playtime each. Regardless if they're branded by a AAA studio or not, it's gameplay and quality that matters. 

In other genres there are also plenty of huge games like No Man's Sky or Elite, Flight Simulator, all the racing games, the great puzzle games etc. There is only very little awareness of what games are out there. People are constantly surprised in VR to find fantastic games they never heard of. Because there is too little marketing.

And that touches on your last point, the market is small because the technical demands and price point are way too high still for most people. For great PCVR experiences on high settings without any technical problems you need a 3080 or more. I think it'll still be a few years until enough people have good enough technology to make it mainstream.

While some of those are good games.... compared to the vast library of PC FPS in the first place it can't compete.   


Population one is a good example of this.   SO lets say you are in Battle royals.  In VR  you got Population One which is the only one with a healthy population.   


On PC?   They have every combination you could want.  The market is full of them all with healthy populations and all with their own quirks and themes.   


>In the meantime we do have plenty of content, we just have too actively look for it.
  

  


  
There's a good amount of content but not enough to fully compete with just PC.   Honestly I would say it's only got 1 truely killer app Half Life Alyx.  It needs at least 1 in every genre to be as big as it should be.

I think that's probably where we completely disagree. VR is competing with flat screens in the same way that flat screens are competing with board games. There are tons of killer apps for board games, Chess, Monopoly, Risk etc. And while flat screens can emulate them, there aren't enough flat screen exclusive AAA board games. 

Luckily, flat screen isn't a board you put on a table. Just as VR isn't a screen you sit still observing. 

VR isn't competing with flat screens, it's a different and new medium finding its place. Flat screens have nothing that VR has to offer, and will never be able to compete with VR. There is no way on flat to get a VR experience, just as there is no way for a board game to give a screen experience.",1

I don't think you know what a killer app is.  A killer app is a program or in this case game that is ONLY available on that system.   All of your examples wouldn't be killer apps as you can play all those board games on a PC.  

I mean Chess was one of the first computer games ever made. 

You could maybe argue Warhammer is but even that isn't as you can play it with Tabletop simulator. 

> AAA board games.

I mean there's Mario Party. 

> VR isn't competing with flat screens,

It very much is.    The people who develop games for VR are the same ones who develop them for flat screen.   

So a choice must be made where to put their time and their money to make the most succesful game.   So even on a development side it's still a competition.  

> There is no way on flat to get a VR experience

Flight sims surely.  MS Flight sim is the same game the only difference is how you view it.   Same with Drving sims as well. 

Can we call VR a new medium since it's been around for what?  30  years now? 

Going back to the original point of this what is needed to get VR more main stream is more games and lower bar for entry.  The Quest 2 has done an amazing job of getting more people into VR but we are still a long way out till it's as second nature as PC or Console games.",1

The Quest can't play games like Boneworks or blade and sorcery which are my two favorite VR games. Pavlov is more profitable for the devs on the quest but handles and looks a lot better connected to a strong PC.

Facebook also massively moderates the Quest store, making it hard for devs to actually sell their game on the quest. So pcvr is looking like the best option for at least starting an indie game. Stride was released on steamvr in early access well before it will be able to release on the Oculus store.

Of course everyone is shifting to the Quest, it's the most affordable option and therefore has the largest player base. But just because a game is released on Xbox or playstation doesn't mean it's not released on PC outside of exclusives, same goes for Oculus store and Steamvr.

- a VR ready GPU (I could only start playing VR when I upgraded from my GTX 760 to my RTX 3080)
- you have to buy games, it is not free 
- you need a VR headset 
- you need allocated space to not destroy your furniture, walls, screen or controllers 
- you need time to configure and play 

I think those points added together allow only a small fraction of the population to be eligible.
It will be mainstream when it will allow casual gaming (for 5 minutes) and low cost. Looking at smartphones, mobile games really became mainstream when basically everybody had access to a smartphone. I remember 10 years ago when I introduced mobile gaming via Angry Birds to 35-40 years old people who had a smartphone but were not playing anything.

Vr growth has been great because it’s slowly rooted and grown over time instead of a flash in the pan. It’s not that pcvr is dying, it’s that quest 2 has shown up and is on its own faster trajectory. 

Pancake games should have more compatibility with vr using its 3d out of the box. I know-vorpx and unity hacks. But I mean a seamless easy transition at any time.

Video game companies are stubborn to change. Vr users are not always preexisting gamers, because gamers are stubborn to change as well. Over time I’ve seen the next gen of vr gamers be those growing up into this new gaming format, and they love it. So vr is playing the long game seemingly.

The current ""solution"" of never being able to move the camera, ever, unless the player's head also moves with it, severely limits your game...which again limits your audience.

So 6 million PCVR capable headsets have flooded the market, and yet PCVR (while still growing) is not growing anywhere near that fast. Everyone that bought a Q2 could use it for PCVR. The fact that a lot of people aren't really signals the fact that the PC hardware was the bottleneck to our growth.

Look, I've been on the VR train since the kickstarter days. The first one I tried was an OG Vive and the first I owned was a CV1. I love PCVR and wish it'd go mainstream, but I just don't see it happening.

Unless we can get to a point where cloud streaming gets really really good, I just don't see PCVR gaming being a massive trend.

Ubiquitous in consumerism as with smartphones? Or millions sold as with either or both Microsoft and Sony consoles? Or that it is used widely in industry?

It needs someone other than/additional to Facebook to make the case for VR/AR/XR.

The case needs to be watertight for the user. Then cost is no longer an issue. Like iPhones are desirable and affordable because we understand that smartphones are useful and desirable. Part of this social. Part of of this is utility.


Why and what is the obsession with VR/AR/XR being mainstream?

VR is already far too useful to have its long-term success predicated by consumer entertainment. AR will take that to the next level. 

What would happen in VR/AR/XR if it did not become mainstream?

Seems this question is most frequently joined with ""AAA games ftw"". VR can survive as a niche. If Facebook kills off its VR in fifteen or twenty years in favour of AR it will not be the death of VR. And by that point AAA games will be such a small part of the overall value of the XR market that it will not matter if they are in AR or VR or not. This needs to see phones and XR devices merging. Apple will do this.

What is XR? And why is it worth mentioning?

Who knows, seems like a buzzword to encapsulate all VR and AR and who knows what else in the future. The technology of AR and VR are too useful to disappear, so they will always exist. 

The mainstream success of XR will be with things that we are only dreaming of right now, and will replace smartphones, consoles, PCs. Light, portable, and useful to contact your granny to remind her that she left the chicken soup bubbling on the stove.",1

Most of those were remade from scratch, based on games that were incredibly constrained when they were created. Early ASW was pretty weak, developers had to design for people using hardware around or under min spec on terrible drivers and bad controllers. A lot of things were holding design back. Superhot was such a mess to port to quest, remaking it from the ground up, that the devs quit VR entirely. Robo Recall was literally given away for free with the rift controllers when they sold them in late 2016. Some of these games are actually ports from PSVR to PC.

So no, go learn about how computational limits work and what holds games back. It's absolutely marketing hype to say that Quest and PC are the same minus some graphics. Onward for example was changed massively outside of graphics, it was a huge sticking point for people when the devs literally lied to users who then showed A B footage of how much had been removed from the game.

That doesn't matter, because the gameplay is the same. The user experience is the same. The only difference _to the player_ is the graphics.

The dirty secret here is that most VR devs don't optimize for shit when they make PC games. This is why most of those games had to be rebuilt. Got a copy of Unity? Got some 8K textures? Got 80 for loops per object? Boom, you're a VR dev. It's very similar to porting games to the Switch - you can see who did a bad job to start with by how crippled their port ends up being. Mostly the big ones work fine! The difference is that the Switch has a lot of AAA games from professional developers, whereas VR has a lot of garage devs leaning on the ridiculous power of many VR systems to get their games to run. Nvidia introduced dynamic tessellation, lens matched shading, and multi-view rendering in 2016. In games where they're all used they'd probably double performance. Nobody uses any of them.

You have to think about it from a player perspective instead of a dev perspective. If I'm making it rain in a scene, I can do it by a custom particle system with individual raycasted raindrops that splash when they land, or I can use a couple 2d sprite sheets. The first one will run at 10fps and the second will run at 80, but they look exactly the same. That's a toy example but it's the kind of thing that causes these problems.

I don't fault VR devs too much for this. Optimization is hard and they have limited resources. But Doom and Witcher 3 can run on the Switch. These problems are not inherent to porting or the Quest hardware, it's perfectly capable of running most games.",0

Graphics and story don't define the same game.  Those are incredibly surface level, so much so its not even worth talking about. The game is the same game so long as the majority of the original developer implemented code is in tact.

 The end user doesn't get to decide what's the same game  If you have to rebuild a game from the ground up it's not the same game even if you slam the same name and assets into it. You also need to consider That the quest uses android, it has its own SDK and tools that differ from the rift, and optimization for ARM is different from that of x86.

 It wouldn't surprise me if much of the game has been rewritten from the ground up. It's not necessarily that it would have problems, more that you're designing for an entirely new platform. This new platform is also a low power mobile platform and is for an architecture you don't even support normally. You're going to have restraints and differences in optimization and implementation.

The code is totally different than the original, but it was marketed and sold as the same game and nobody complained. By your definition PS3 and 360 versions of things would be different games. If the mechanics, levels, AI, etc. are all identical, it doesn't matter if they work differently in ways the user can't see.

Gives devs the wider audience so they won't be discouraged by making for a niche group while giving players new to VR a good starting off point.  The enthusiast standpoint of ""ground up for VR"" can hurt things by discouraging these things.  

Yes, games made for VR have the best immersion, but games like Skyrim, Fallout, Borderlands (these 3 have obvious signs they were originally flat screen games), Elite Dangerous, and games with community mods can contribute the most playtime.  With the first 3 examples, it would have been nice if instead of a standalone VR version purchase that it was just a toggleable option like Elite Dangerous and racing sims, or in the least a reasonably priced DLC.  If there wasn't so much pressure for VR versions to come with all the features, maybe something as simple as GTAV's REAL mod would be more acceptable to ship in a base product.  In the end, we should be looking at how to enjoy a game instead of why we shouldn't.  Won't stop made for VR games from being made.

If more games shipped with VR as an option, would encourage the hardware sales as well.  I didn't purchase a racing wheel until I acquired multiple titles that could support it, as otherwise it would have seemed like a heftier purchase in the end.

Many excellent points being by others in this thread. I'm mainly familiar with the VR side of things.

I write and illustrate children's books for a living. My husband bought me my very first VR headset: a Quest 2 for Christmas last year. I've fallen hard down the VR rabbit hole since then. Even though I've been an Apple person all my life, I ended up **buying my very first PC** (ASUS ROG Strix Scar 15, 2021) solely so I could run certain apps (Adobe Medium, Quill, PC version of Tilt Brush, PC version of VRchat). Since it's related to my work (I'm using 3D to help sketch layout scenes), I can claim at least part of this as a business expense. So I do think that as tech gradually improves on cheaper headsets and more types of software become available, it will appeal to more people.

I am HIGHLY prone to **motion sickness**; I can't even use swings on the playground with my nieces anymore, ugh. I did try an early version of a friend's VR headset (can't remember what it was) years ago and immediately got queasy so didn't try VR again for years after. It was only after he convinced me to try his Oculus Rift that I started wanting my own VR headset. But I still do encounter the same resistance from others now (""Oh, I can't use VR - I'll just get motion sick."") And during the pandemic, especially where I live in Ontario, it's been impossible for friends to try out VR. **So perhaps as it becomes easier for people to try out VR headsets (in stores, in people's homes), VR will gain more converts**?

As for the comments about content: I do think there is already a ton of great content out there and it continues to improve. For the record: I'm not a first-person shooter type of person (and there is a LOT of that kind of content :-) and tend to avoid graphic violence but just recently was intrigued by all the positive reviews for *In Death: Unchained* and am now totally hooked. I tried a couple of others but returned them as being too gorey or motion sickness-inducing; I love that we can try out games for a bit and return them in the Oculus store if we don't like them. **So despite initially believing I was going to stick with art and productivity apps, I am exploring AND enjoying new types of VR content**. Also have been loving *Demeo*, playing it solo skirmish mode as well as multiplayer with friends.

Many of my non-gamer friends who have bought VR headsets did so partly for **the social aspect**, especially during the pandemic, but I've noticed that while they used VR social apps more often earlier in the pandemic, they've been doing so less often as things open up again in their areas, or going back to regular video conferencing like Zoom because the current headsets are just too big / clunky / hair-squishing...and that brings me to my final point:

I strongly agree that **smaller, lighter headsets** will help increase appeal. One point I rarely see mentioned is the issue of Oculus head/hair. :-D I do a LOT of virtual meetings, virtual school visits, virtual presentations, and I find that wearing my Quest 2 headset can sometimes leave marks on my face, flatten my bangs, sculpt my hair into weird shapes that are hard to brush out.

Example: https://imgur.com/gallery/c5k1Zaj

As a result, I tend to avoid VR when I know I have an online event coming up. I've experimented with different types of accessories and am currently using a Frankenquest set-up. The ""Oculus hair"" is still an issue. :-) Sounds minor and vain and is obviously not a problem for anyone with short hair or no bangs, but this definitely affects how/when I use my VR headset. I can't wait until smaller/lighter versions eventually come out!

Thanks again for starting this thread. So interesting to read the wide range of perspectives.
