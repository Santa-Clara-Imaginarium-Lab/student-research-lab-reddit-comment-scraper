You are locked in a 1st person view, time to kill is often instant and information about callouts, what hp enemies are at and other split-second decisions can’t be transmitted in time through just pings and text chat. It’s like playing League without using pings.

League of Legends however are a middle-ground where voice-comms don’t play as central of a role as an FPS but would help in areas like non-premade botlanes where duos have a big advantage (which had to be removed at high elo), junglers giving info to laners about pathing plans and teamfight coordination.

Ideally? Tens of thousands for a game as big as league. Realistically in the 5000 range. If Riot were to implement this I'd like if it was first only on random accounts who havent been reported often and then said accounts and people they play can fill out surveys on how it went.

>If voice comms were a built in STANDARD of the game (like it is in Overwatch), you'd be expected to use them even if you're ""allowed"" not to.

I dont have stats on this so all I can claim is my own experience, but I've been heavily flamed for not using voice in OW.

Bad wording I guess. My point is posting a discord link (or any third party app) is different from voice being built into the game.

>Setting up unrealistic expectations so you can continue using ""low sumple size"" excuse, smart. But if some1 went ahead and do it, I wonder what would the next excuse be?

Because this isnt work for one person. Its work Riot would/should do to test a feature for THEIR games. They can handle it, they're a huge company. But if someone somehow collected thousands of reviews from all elos and made a report, comparing toxicity levels to games without vc, I'd acquiesce.

Just because getting that many people is hard doesnt mean using less people is statistically significant.

You're only at a disadvantage if people use the comms to actually win the game. If communication was as important as people make it seem, why do so many professional players advocate turning the chat off in solo queue?

People are completely fine muting the text based chat but when it's about voice communication people try to oversell it ten fold when it's the same principle.

Communication tools are only as effective as people make them, if the majority of communication is negative or flaming then you're not losing out on much - to the point where even some people in Challenger say that it's better to turn the chat off because the loss is non negligible.

You even say later in your own comment that apparently most people in voice just yell racist insults, yet people are somehow at a massive disadvantage for not using them. It's just BS, you're twisting the narrative however it suits your argument. At first it's a disadvantage and a sentence down it's only racist insults.

Personally as someone who used to play years of both HoN and DotA 2 both of which have built in voice comms, I'm indifferent and I don't think that it affected my solo queue results one way or another. If someone was being toxic I muted them and the few people that used comms properly could have easily typed most of what they were saying, it's not going to give you a 10% win rate increase despite people wanting to believe that.

If anything voice comms for solo queue are nothing but a quality of life feature, it lets people who want to use them play more comfortably but you're not going to gain some massive advantage and skyrocket a rank upwards. 

In all my years of playing HoN and DotA I never encountered a game where a team of 5 randoms in solo queue all came together in voice and communicated, in the best case scenario it was 1 or 2 people using voice while everyone else typed into the chat. It's just preference, that's all it is. It won't increase teamwork by all that much in a solo queue setting for most players.",10

Because people rarely type something useful and it reduces APM and concentration also you have to type fast. People mostly type when they're dead or running from base.

Providing critical and actual information with voice is much easier and faster. You won't coordinate gank in text chat but in voice chat it's easy, for example. Same with duo bot. Why do you think every high-elo player complained about duos? Why riot had to restrict it to diamond and lower? Coordination. Duo use voice and become more than sum of their parts.",24

It was specifically to target high elo where professional teams play, hence why Riot still allows people to duo at lower ranks up to diamond because professional players won't be playing in that elo and a non-pro duo queue doesn't skew the game into unacceptable levels. Using that hyper specific example to talk about voice comms seems like a stretch to me.

As for the rest of what you commented, I had a long ramble typed out but it's just way too long of a comment so I'm going to condense my point down to the fact that from personal experience of -5 years of playing solo queue in two other MOBAs with built in voice comms it has never been an impactful feature as far as win rate or coordination goes, and League doesn't have some secret ingredient that makes voice comms more important than they are in DotA or HoN.

For some reason it seems like every person who uses the ""disadvantage"" argument has never played other MOBAs with built in voice comms and are living in a dream world of some ideal view, whereas the people who have actually experience with DotA or HoN voice comms never really talk about disadvantages or advantages at all because in reality the feature is nothing but a quality of life change and doesn't actually amount to anything impactful in solo queue outside of maybe the top 0.1% players in Challenger who would actually like that feature.",1

You speak english and you probably think - ah i can speak it...its fine for me. But what happens when you find a team that cna;'t speak or isn't willing to speak the language ? and u face a team that is able to speak.

In statistics, there's a thing known as Selection Bias. Through selection bias, the way participants in a study are found isn't properly randomized/chosen to represent a specific demographic. Instead, some factor influences who/what is chosen, which leads to a certain sample having unevenly weighted participation.

One example of selection bias is Volunteer Bias. Volunteer Bias occurs when the participants of the sample are self-selected. Most commonly, this is seen with things like online reviews: The only people who provide their experiences with a product/service are the ones who actually fill out the review. The reason this leads to atypical results is that participants are only those who are involved by choice, meaning those who are disinterested will opt out of participation, and thus only the ""enthusiastic"" individuals (be it positive enthusiasm or negative enthusiasm) are actually sampled.

What does this mean for the Voice Chat study? Well, the experiment was conducted on a self-selected volunteer basis. That means the only people who are being studied and surveyed are those already willing to join in the voice chat, and thus are going to be people who are interested in the first place. Because of this, if there's some person who just doesn't want to chat, they won't join the chat, and thus not be able to describe nor provide their experiences with the system. In other words, the only people who are participating in the study are those who want to use voice chat in the first place (as they were willing to join and be involved in it).

Why this is important is because of the sample taken. OP says they conducted this experiment over 67 games, with 101 participants out of a possible 268 (Up to 4 other people can join in each of the 67 games). This means that despite having an experience of 101 other people join the voice call, 167 people did not opt in or participate. In other words, **the majority of possible participants did not join the voice chat**. 

To use this as 'proof' of any metric (e.g. ""People enjoyed using voice chat"", ""People were nice and friendly in voice chat"", ""People were better able to win using voice chat"") would have to factor in the number of participants who chose not to participate in the study, and that means that the most common response to this voice chat is ""I did not choose to use it"". As such, drawing any conclusion from the data is going to have a big asterisk next to it, because it is a minority opinion to opt into voice chat at all, and thus not reflective of the whole League of Legends playerbase.",70

Eg. Pings are optional, you can be flamed for not pinging. However, it's good that pings are available

Smart-casting is optional. You can be flamed for using abilities badly. However, it's good that smartcast is available. 

Locking your camera is optional. You can be flamed for playing on locked camera. However, it's good that  there's an option to play either locked or unlocked.

Summoner spells are optional. You can be flamed for taking ignite instead of TP top lane. However, it's good that summoner spell choices are available. 

Rune pages are optional. You can be flamed for taking non-meta runes (or even meta runes by the uninformed), however it's good that rune choices are available. 

Voicecomms are optional. You can be flamed for not using voice comms, therefore this feature is bad?

I know you don't really care and you're not the right person to reply to, but i think the argument that voice comms are bad because people will be pressured to use it is blatantly flawed.

Remember they were concerned about adding training tool because people might be flamed to go play in practice mode? Looking back, does anyone think adding the training tool was a mistake?",8

If you implement voice comms, the expectation is that everyone uses it. Otherwise, you're putting your team at a disadvantage. It's not 100% always the case but generally, 5 people who are communicating and can formulate a plan are going to be better than 4 people or 3 people with 1-2 silent teammates. 

So if you implement voice comms, you've now given your playerbase a dilemma. They need to comm to increase their chances at winning. But what if you have a bad play and your teammates start saying some vile shit? People say to mute but now the rest of your team is still talking and you're left on an island. So inherently, your team's chances are now worse. Or maybe you're a woman and your teammates are acting like sexist assholes. You're still trying to win but don't want to deal with verbal harassment. If you mute them, that's information being lost across the entire team. 

Without voice comms, everyone is communicating using the same system. Yeah, people could be in a discord together but that's not controlled by Riot. With voice comms, you run the risk of creating imbalances across the two teams depending on who happened to roll the ragebaby.",5

Text comms are dogshit, 99% of the time over a 30 minute game there won't be a single line of useful information. They require a lot of input (relative to pings and voice comms) and distract both the player typing the message and the ones receiving it. Using them or not doesn't contribute to the team's performance in the slightest, their only use is flaming your jungler while you wait to respawn. Voice comms on the other hand are far more practical, allowing you to share and receive information even while smashing your head on the keyboard.

So, teenagers? Teenagers tend to care a lot more about arbitrary goals in gaming (intentionality) and have more mental resources to devote to the game since they tend to have less going on in their lives compared to adults (focus). 

Don’t underestimate children, especially those with no real life goals and under the influence of gaming addiction.

It’s pretty funny that every time I get into an argument with a toxic player, I ask them what their education is and they always reply with some bullshit like “I have a PhD in astrophysics” or don’t reply at all.

I imagine if they could join in the middle of the game easily to flame when something goes wrong, they would.

In any case, one of the things that always drew me to League was the lack of a voice chat. League has prided itself on a low barrier to entry, and it's one of the things that drew me to the game in the first place. It doesn't matter how bad your computer is, it doesn't matter if you don't have a mic, you can still play a game of League. If you add a microphone as a requirement to it, you'll wind up making the game harder to get into.

Women also just can't participate in it with the same experience men do. It's just not a great experience if you're a woman most of the time. Heck, this extends to men who don't sound super masculine, or foreigners. I've heard them get treated like garbage too when i've played Overwatch and Valorant.

Not joining voice chat is an option, but it's a worse experience than the game is now since people aren't going to be willing to pass along their communication in pings or chat like they do now. Some games you'll also be pestered and trolled if you don't join voice chat.

In any case, communication won't really fix a lot of the issues people think it will in low diamond and below(It may not be better higher, but I can only speak for what i've played in). People still aren't going to listen to you, people are still going to ignore what you say then flame you despite you literally just telling them something, etc. The only thing that'll be different is that you'll be talking instead of pinging, and people's passive aggressive remarks will be flame instead of pings, and you'll see a lot more sexism and racism.",56

Those are only relevant on consoles nowadays though. NA has the problem of jumping to whatever's popular at the moment nonstop.

The dedication and attachment is simply not on the same level, and consoles eat up a huge portion of the market.

For example my Plan was to snowball our bot and mid but my toplaner didn't see that or didn't understand so he flamed bc the enemy Jgl is camping him but if I would have told him in loading screen that I want to snowball our bot because for example I have a Draven adc and if he would play weakside he would get problems and my toplaner is a Ornn that don't really need so much Gold to be useful, he could play according to this Plan, try to freeze and ward better.

It's extremely rare that people even Join. So i just don't get the purpose of you doing this.  
If riot forces a voicesystem into League, pretty much everyone is forced to use it, or else he thinks that he is in a disadvantage, therefore he already is in bad mood because he never wanted to talk, and that's when 50times more ragers are coming. Also frankly, if i'm doing well ingame, and i have 4 inters in my team, dicksucking and blaming each other while i try to 1v9 I do not want to hear that. it's as useless as the Chat. If this information would be so good, no one would mute the chat, but there is a extreme amount of High elo players that disable the chat function, and communicate with the Pings itself. league isn't that complex.

People who want voice chat have been less likely to start playing the game. They are more likely to quit along the way than someone who isn't dissatisfied with the lack of voice chat.

People who don't want voice chat are more likely to start playing, and they're more likely to stick around instead of switching to one of League's competitors that use voice chat.


--

Valorant releasing with voice chat is a pretty clear sign that Riot isn't inherently opposed to the idea. They released the game, it released with voice chat, and everyone knows what they sign up for if they play Valorant. There's no one to disgruntle or push away cause there was no Valorant player base prior to the launch.

--

It's really simple. Riot looked at League's player base. Analyzed it surveyed it, then asked themselves: Will adding voice chat attract more people to the game than the ones we'd be pushing away because of it? Are there people we could hold onto by adding it that would otherwise quit in the future?

--

You can't ""just mute:"" The problem isn't toxicity, the problem is that not using voice chat is a competitive disadvantage. After 11 years this game has either gathered or shaped countless of people into players that don't want voice chat, and those people aren't gonna shrug their shoulders and press ""opt out"" when it's out. They're gonna jump ship, at least they're more likely to do so than they'd be without it. And Riot is fully aware that no one who doesn't care about League is suddenly gonna start playing cause IGN releases an article saying ""LEAGUE OF LEGENDS NOW HAS VOICE CHAT.""

Little to gain, lots to lose.",27

No point in making ""what if's?"" when the game has been the most popular multiplayer game for the majority of the last decade and it has never implemented voice chat unlike many other rival games.

League is a complex multiplayer game where working with your team is arguably \*more\* important than your individual play. As such leagues chat system + pings is just not good enough for the level of communication you need to play the game effectively. See: every single pro team uses voice. 

Further, without voice chat and that added level of teamwork/communication, the divide between pro-play and soloq is huge. Its basically 2 different games. And you don't even need to be a pro to see this, if you've ever played clash as a 5 man pre-made, against another 5 man, you can feel the difference. There shouldn't be such a big divide between ""organized play"" and soloq, it should all just be ""league of legends"". Adding voice chat is crucial for this. 

Adding voice will also make the game less toxic overall. People are less likely to flame and troll when they are made aware of the actual humans behind the screen, rather than anonymous characters typing in chat. Its much easier to forgive bad play when you hear someone say ""shoot my bad"" on voice. Moreover, adding voice means that people who want to shotcall their team have an actual means of doing so. So instead of just having to \*assume\* or \*hope\* your teammates know whats going on, you can just tell them, reducing frustration and making people less likely to act out where they might have otherwise in the current system. 

The current system absolutely is ""broke"". We're just all conditioned to it because we have no choice. Having to expect your teammates to read your mind, or instantly react to your plays with no warning is insane. No other game limits their players in this way. A ping could mean a million different things in each unique situation, its not good enough.",1

Every relevant competitive team game EVER has had voice comms and there has never been an issue. Yes, once every dozen games you’ll find someone who is toxic or whining in comms but you can easily mute them. 

I’ve played CSGO for years and i can count on one hand the number of times i’ve had legit toxic people in comms. I don’t mean “man wtf are you doing?” That’s not toxic. I mean cussing, slurs, screaming, etc.

Now the prblem with most studdies like this is that they aren't trully randomized simply because it's not exactly viable to do true randomized studies.

For example , if they get 10 000 random, average people for their trials , you would say that's a pretty good control group , yes?

wrong. because in most studies like this , they don't actually take into account a lot of things. Like the results you would get from interviewing people from a big city - like the capital of the country , with results from rural areas. A company that would want to make a point , could easily do so by missrepresenting stats and it wouldn't technically be wrong.",1

>ou literally used the most rare and cherrypicked example possible in the argument

i think u don't realize how many people can't actually speak the language simply because they dont type. u see the people that type daily and you assume everyone can understand the chat.

a lot of the people that enver chat don't do it because they have the chat muted. some legitimatly don't understand jack shit of whats being said.

pretty much each game has at least 1 person that never talks or just talks in his native language in my games.


>For every con in a VC system there are 3 pros.

and the pros only matter if the people can communicate. if the people on your team can't use the coms , this system adds nothing for you.....but massively improves synergy in the enemy team if they have people that cna comunicate.

Most game no one even used it but at least you have the option, and When someone is toxic in voice chat (rare) you can just mute them. 
Some people (me included) don't instantly mute text toxicity because it's not that annoying, but when someone is toxic in voice chat you have to hear their voice, so they are muted faster generally, which in turn make people less toxic in voice chat since if you know everyone muted you /will mute you if you are toxic, then there's no point in talking at all.

I do think voice comms offers a competitive advantage and it makes level of game play higher. I had higher win% when playing with voice comms that I usually do. 

At least in Europe I doubt that cultures suffer differently because there no majority culture in Europe. Russia has largest population in Europe and their European population is under 15% of whole European population. French players could one of the most effected players because they can have heavy accent which can make them harder to understand. 

Yes it would be unfair to some people, but when you change things there will be always people that it is unfair towards to.

League is not like a tactical shooter that relies on instant communication and everything happens super fast, the ping system can account for a lot of the communication in game. But there are certain things that can't really be said through pings and you can't sit there and type out. If you don't want to participate in it, then don't. Not everyone has to because the game doesn't rely on it as much as other games. As long as you're listening, I don't see how it is a huge disadvantage.

Would people hold this logic up for other things? Should Riot also hardlock the game at 60 fps because people with better hardware have an advantage? Should Riot not allow you to use a mouse with a polling rate over 125 as to not impede on those who can't have better hardware?

The idea that Riot shouldn't implement something that is in every competitive video game in the history of ever because of a minority of a minority of players that would also be completely optional does not make sense.

They will suffer more harassment. 

This will not only cause a performance disadvantage but might also stop them from playing ranked league or prevent new people who might otherwise have played league from playing. 

If that reason is not sufficient from a ""competitve, ranked standpoint"", then I say I want to see women pros playing in the LEC, LCS, LPL, LCK in my lifetime and for that to not be an extraordinary thing. My assumption (and I will be more than happy to be wrong here) is that voice chat reduces the chance of that happening by reducing the number of women playing the game at a competitve level.

Also like I said and you conveniently ignored most of my reply, it is completely optional. They could add it tomorrow and you could continue playing league as you have played it for years and years and the feature could be ignored. Players aren't going to stop pinging after pinging for a decade. The advantages of voice chat vastly outweigh the downsides and that is why every competitive game ever made outside of League, (even those made by Riot themselves) include the feature. It is ridiculous that one of the biggest games in the world that is so team-dependent, where solo carrying is all but dead, doesn't have the most basic feature of communication.",-1

Technically, pinging and typing to your teammates is completely optional, you can go in game right now and type /mute all and then boom you're putting your team at a disadvantage and riot allows you to do it. What's a bigger disadvantage? You pinging, typing, and listening in a League with VC, or you going in game right now and typing /mute all in the current League. I know that women uniquely deal with shitty people in game, I have seen it happen plenty, but I don't think that because of this and honestly only this, there's really no other even slightly valid reason, that Riot shouldn't allow such a basic feature for a competitive game. Games would be less random, teammates would work together better. People always talk about differences between solo queue and pro play when it comes to balance and such, well I think something that could help close the gap in gameplay could be making it as similar to pro play as possible with something as basic as voice chat.  


I'm repeating myself from my first message but perhaps I wasn't clear enough, not everyone needs to talk and not everyone needs to say things 24/7. Pinging and typing can suffice for most situations in the game but being able to communicate vocally would be a lot easier, allow for more in depth comms, and leave less things up to individual interpetation. Not everyone talks in other competitive games with VC, but they listen to their teammates calls and that proves to usually be enough.",-1

Yes, so why should I want an *additional* source of disadvantage that (effective use of) the chat system does? Not that its used effectively that often anywhere other than high elo

I would love it if Riot removed chat and replaced it with a more comprensive ping communication system. 

>  I know that women uniquely deal with shitty people in game, I have seen it happen plenty, but I don't think that because of this and honestly only this, there's really no other even slightly valid reason, that Riot shouldn't allow such a basic feature for a competitive game

We will have to disagree on this. As I said, pinging doesn't give away someone's gender, typing does not. Voice does. And for me, the negatives from that outweigh any positives that voice chat might bring. 

> Pinging and typing can suffice for most situations in the game but being able to communicate vocally would be a lot easier, allow for more in depth comms, and leave less things up to individual interpetation. 

Anything that could be voiced could be communicated through a better ping system. If people want better communication, maybe we should pester Riot for this.",3

It makes every competitive game so much better and women still benefit from that, even if they have to mute people way more often.

I think you really overvalue the competitive advantage voice comms give, most people can't properly communicate anyways. It's obviously purely speculation, but I think the scenario where a team wins without voice comms, but would lose with voice comms, doesn't happen very often. Voice comms can't save you from getting outplayed.

More importantly I believe more women using voice comms and normalizing
 it, is the best way to eliminate the sexism long term.

Now run your test in all elos. If you don’t want to smurf then find a buddy in that elo and have them run the test for you and report back results.

Run the test when you don’t sound like the homogeneous pack.

Run it sounding like a woman.

Run it sounding like you are younger or older than the homogeneous pack.

Run it sounding like you’re using gay male speech ([https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gay_male_speech](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gay_male_speech)) 

Run it sounding like you have an accent.

Run it sounding like you have a speech affectation (stuttering, Tourette’s, etc.).

If you’re part of the homogeneous pack then voice chat probably sounds amazing. As soon as you stand out in any way, shape or form then your results are likely to differ immensely (and most likely be negative). Not understanding this is what is called privilege.

Using voice comms is very beneficial for giving call-outs and working out strategies when you have only seconds to act. As for voice comms with randoms. I wish it automatically put everyone in together like in games like CoD. Of course give people the ability to mute the lobby, but I think this would do a lot to reduce player toxicity, and improve win rates. It wouldn’t be hard to do this at all. 

Riot doesn’t really seem interested in actually doing anything to improve the community though. At least not in regards to toxicity. They just want to look like they care.
Reporting during champion selection does nothing. Reporting post game does nothing unless someone typed something racist. Dodging a lobby because someone is obviously trying to ruin the game?

I am talking from a position of (granted anecdotal)  experience. I have played in a moba with voice chat (dota 2). People don't use it to do huge long term strategies, they predominantly use it to either express hype after a good play or do a quick call out because typing is inconvenient and their chat wheel is full of memes. The most I have needed to use voice chat is to explain the concept of a half pull to a support, and from then I could say Half-pull pls.

Any long complex thoughts that need to be said probably have the time to be written in text chat, because it involves a long term strategy. This would include champ select. This means it would have the same language issues as voice chat.

League has a lot of decision making involved and players who aren't confident will often play like they are behind even if they're entire team has 20 kills and 10k gold ahead of the enemy.

In many of my games, toxicity comes after plays that failed. Rarely do people say toxic things or grief from minute 1 without a clear trigger event. What's a rarely utilized method to coordinate plays better on average than your soloq opponents? Getting the team in a voice chat. Personally, I will not join a random discord link sent to me by someone I don't know and have seen that others do the same. I suspect that if everyone did join discords for some reason, the decreased anonymity, increased ""intimacy"" (eg being forced to realize your teammates are real humans with thoughts and feelings, not robots that die on purpose to troll your games), and enhanced communication would lead to less toxicity in game. Others have gotten very hung up on your sample. I see no obvious way for you to get a better sample.

The biggest issue is that most of those people arent good at coms and dont really give much useful info / ignore my call outs.  (Just like most ignore pings of roams and die without vc) it's not even the fact they are randoms because I have a few groups I play with and half of those people are brain deficient and ignore pings and or  call outs of roams and mia. 

Since I'm a girl I do get the occasional incel/monkey but to be honest I'm pretty toxic and I usually just make fun of their voice and call them fat or virgin and they either chill and play normally or just rage quit so it's not that much of an issue. Definitely more likely for them to try and be edgy and toxic if you sound female tho and it is a added burden on the female player to screen and deal with these morons.",1

Would have loved to join, but had irl background noise cuz staying in family's place+I think someone dodged the lobby.  


Anyways, I've always been a huge supporter of voice chat, or at least the option to use it. IT IS ALREADY AN OPTION WITH THE DISCORD LINK ANYWAYS. Having an in-built voice chat just removes the need to click/send a random link in champselect and potentially get a keylogger to use voice chat.  


After playing mostly Dota 2 instead of League, I support voice chat even more. I am still very low elo in Dota 2(silver equivalent in league), but my experience with voice chat has still been mostly positive. This is an elo that most people say is the most toxic, but voice chat has mostly been chill shotcalling and ""nice!"" ""good job!"" etc. with ofc the occasional russian screamers this being dota and all. It has still mostly had a positive impact in the games.  


A compromise could maybe be only giving voice chat to master+ elo, where people are more likely to give a damn about the game and not be toxic, but I'd rather have it for everyone.  


Maybe I should start sending links in the chat as well as long as it's not implemented.",1

Most people who don’t want voice chat because they assume it’s some toxic hellscape haven’t actually used voice chat in games, because in reality toxic people are insecure about themselves and 99% of the time won’t join voice because of it.",0
