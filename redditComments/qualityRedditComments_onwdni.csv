This article has some jscript specific code. I could post what I've done but it's in powershell so not sure if that would be useful or not. It's only a few lines of code

As of now, I have this. Could you check? I haven't dealt with recursion much so next for clearing up my qualms !

EDIT: Nvm i think i got it ! tysm for your recursive solution!",1
