"rich","The Cavaliers facing the same problem as the Steph/Monta Warriors","The Cleveland Cavaliers are facing the same problem as the Monta Ellis/Steph Curry Warriors. 

In 2010, the Warriors had a backcourt that was great even if the team wasn’t making the playoffs. Monta Ellis was averaging 25 points despite not being an all-star and was the team’s franchise player. They also had a 21 year old Steph Curry who was averaging 17 points. Curry was the better player, but Monta was the franchise.

Monta was traded for Bogut. The next year, Curry broke out averaging 23 points and the Warriors upset the Denver Nuggets before losing to the Spurs. 

In 2021, the Cavaliers have a backcourt that is great even if the team isn't making the playoffs. Colin Sexton is averaging 24 points despite not being an all-star and is the team’s franchise player. They also have a 21 year old Darius Garland who is averaging 17 points. Garland is the better player, but Colin is the franchise.

The parallels are clear. Should the Cavaliers pull the plug on this duo?","https://redd.it/ofr68i",10297909,1625689091000,"[]","{""url"":null}",,,"{""name"":""r/nba | 4033299 Subscribers"",""iconURL"":""https://cdn.discordapp.com/avatars/799722126784725042/5de289dd938456254174b76c8e75f01d.webp""}",,"{""text"":""[Self Post by /u/Rahul____Raja] | [1 👍] | [0 👎 ] | [2 📃]""}","[]"
