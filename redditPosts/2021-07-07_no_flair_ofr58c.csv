"rich","Isn't it ridiculous to think Luka Doncic is on his way to becoming the GOAT?","I just saw a highly upvoted comment in another thread that said it's unfortunate how Marvin Bagley was picked ahead of a player on the ""GOAT path""


Gonna assume this is referring to Doncic and while he's looking like a future hall of famer I feel like it's absolutely crazy to say he can be the GOAT. The chance is higher than 0% sure, but it's not high enough where you can unironically call him the future GOAT.","https://redd.it/ofr58c",10297909,1625689008000,"[]","{""url"":null}",,,"{""name"":""r/nba | 4033299 Subscribers"",""iconURL"":""https://cdn.discordapp.com/avatars/799722126784725042/5de289dd938456254174b76c8e75f01d.webp""}",,"{""text"":""[Self Post by /u/mrscorchingtakes] | [0 👍] | [0 👎 ] | [7 📃]""}","[]"
