"rich","[AMA] I’m Mirin Fader and I’m the author of the upcoming book, Giannis: The Improbable Rise of an NBA MVP. AMA!","I’m a staff writer for The Ringer, writing long form, human interest sports features on athletes across all sports. I write about sports but I really write about people. I’ve profiled many NBA and NFL stars, including Brandon Ingram, LaMelo Ball, Ja Morant, Davante Adams, and more. My book on Giannis Antetokounmpo, set to come out August 10, was born out of a feature I wrote on Giannis and his youngest brother, Alex, for Bleacher Report Mag, where I wrote previously.
