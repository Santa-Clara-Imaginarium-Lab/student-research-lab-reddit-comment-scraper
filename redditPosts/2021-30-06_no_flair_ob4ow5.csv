"rich","Kyrie Irving against Golden States, KD and Klay against Raptors, Bam and Goran Dragic against Lakers, Everyone against whoever this season. Injuries do decide championships.","Injuries are a deciding factor. The only time you get an asterisk is if there is cheating. Like bounty gate where they purposely injure players in the NFL.  Or spygate where teams would spy on other teams. Or sports betting which can lead to rigging among refs and players. Or Barry Bonds juicing. In this case the asterisk is not because of injuries. But because either John Collins or Deandre Ayton win and they both got caught for using banned substances. But no one cares because Jon Jones is still the ""Goat"" in the eyes of UFC fans. So you would have to retest them to be fair instead of just sweeping it under the rug like they'll try to.","https://redd.it/ob4ow5",10297909,1625081580000,"[]","{""url"":null}",,,"{""name"":""r/nba | 4020989 Subscribers"",""iconURL"":""https://cdn.discordapp.com/avatars/799722126784725042/5de289dd938456254174b76c8e75f01d.webp""}",,"{""text"":""[Self Post by /u/runepoon] | [3 👍] | [0 👎 ] | [66 📃]""}","[]"
