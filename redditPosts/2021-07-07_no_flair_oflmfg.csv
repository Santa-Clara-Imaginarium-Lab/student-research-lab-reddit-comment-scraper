>Can't Knock The Hustle author Matt Sullivan (@Sullduggery) reports Kyrie Irving is building a disability-friendly home for a young victim of gun violence. Sullivan acknowledges ""there are complications with (Irving's) character"", but says Irving's humanitarianism is remarkable.

>Sullivan: ""The kid tells the doctor that Kyrie is his favorite player. The doctor goes out on a limb and reaches out... and Kyrie is gonna build this kid a house, a disability-friendly house.
