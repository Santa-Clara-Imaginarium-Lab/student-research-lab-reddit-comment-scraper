"rich","Should any of the past 2 seasons have an asterisk?","For the past 2 years, we’ve been introduced to this idea of putting an asterisk on a season. It’s quickly become a word that is being used in the basketball community as people wonder if the champions that are crowned that season are ‘legitimate’ winners. 

I personally don’t think any season should have an asterisk on it because then you could literally put one on every season. Every season and path to winning is different. Sure it involves some luck but it always does.

Do you think any of the past 2 seasons should have an asterisk on it? If so, which one?","https://redd.it/ofq6nv",10297909,1625686121000,"[]","{""url"":null}",,,"{""name"":""r/nba | 4033298 Subscribers"",""iconURL"":""https://cdn.discordapp.com/avatars/799722126784725042/5de289dd938456254174b76c8e75f01d.webp""}",,"{""text"":""[Self Post by /u/BigPhotojournalist27] | [0 👍] | [0 👎 ] | [71 📃]""}","[]"
