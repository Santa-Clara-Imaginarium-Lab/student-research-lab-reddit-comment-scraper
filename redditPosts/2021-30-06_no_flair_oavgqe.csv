"rich","Despite what happens with the Milwaukee Bucks from here on out, Doc Rivers and Mike Budenholzer should be fired this offseason.","What are the Sixers and Bucks front offices even doing?

You could not take fully advantage of the Nets superteam being injured because your coaches are completely being outcoached and coaching like it is the 90s. 

People in general overestimate a team Championship window, even a Superstar like Giannis that isn't injury prone can suffer a freak injury out of nowhere so you have to take full advantage of your Superstar right now, not next year or the year after.

The Sixers are completely botching Joel Embiid's championship window for refusing to move on from Ben Simmons and Doc Rivers this offseason. Your 7ft center is playing like a guard, not because he wants too, but because he is being forced too and he is on the 76ers since 2014. This is mind-blowing.

Both coaches have awful rotations that already cost them games this year and completely gassing out their own players having to play unnecessary games for not being 100% ready out there. If it was not for money they would have been fired already, so it is basically money that is stopping a billionaire owner from giving their franchise a championship? I don't get it. Just fire them tomorrow, you have good GM's and there are a lot of good X's and O's coaches that will actually make an impact in the game and help your Superstar players thrive.","https://redd.it/oavgqe",10297909,1625053022000,"[]","{""url"":null}",,,"{""name"":""r/nba | 4021123 Subscribers"",""iconURL"":""https://cdn.discordapp.com/avatars/799722126784725042/5de289dd938456254174b76c8e75f01d.webp""}",,"{""text"":""[Self Post by /u/allinasecond] | [5360 üëç] | [0 üëé ] | [1017 üìÉ]""}","[]"
