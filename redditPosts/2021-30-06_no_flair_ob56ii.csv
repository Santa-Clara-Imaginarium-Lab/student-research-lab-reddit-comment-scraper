"rich","Which NBA Playoffs will/should be viewed as less impressive than a standard playoff season: 2020 or 2021?","Calling either of these an asterisk or fraudulent is a bridge too far, but both are pretty well outside the standard of quality and normalcy that we expect from the NBA playoffs. Last year’s Lakers team is astronomically better than any of the teams remaining this time around, but they had a lot of things go their way logistically. I don’t know how I’d come down on this TBH. 

2020: the league - including one LeBron James, who has logged more minutes than anyone in the NBA the last 15 years - gets a 3 month rest and then plays in a bubble with no fans, no travel, and no road games. 

2021: 10 of the 12 best players in the league get seriously or moderately hurt either directly before or during the playoffs, leading to a Finals that will, at best, feature maybe the 5th or 6th best team in the league.","https://redd.it/ob56ii",10297909,1625082986000,"[]","{""url"":null}",,,"{""name"":""r/nba | 4020999 Subscribers"",""iconURL"":""https://cdn.discordapp.com/avatars/799722126784725042/5de289dd938456254174b76c8e75f01d.webp""}",,"{""text"":""[Self Post by /u/thisisbyrdman] | [0 👍] | [0 👎 ] | [19 📃]""}","[]"
