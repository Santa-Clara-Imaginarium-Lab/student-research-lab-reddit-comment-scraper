>Some of the more interesting highlights from the first 10 minutes of the Sullivan interview, it's a REALLY interesting listen. Everything that's not a direct quote from someone else is a quote/ paraphrase of Sullivan's words:


>Back when KD was on GS, Steve Kerr took KD out for a drink when he was sick of KD being on his burners and checking his DMs all the time. He said ""you know what I respect about Lebron? | respect the fact that when he got to Miami and he got sick of the narratives, sick of the haters, all the talk. You know what he did? Lebron just said fuck it and was great. Same with Michael, same with Kobe. Same with all the greats. They all had to say fuck it and then they were all on that next level. So you know what you gotta do? You just gotta say 'fuck it' like Lebron did.""
He tried to get KD to stop beefing with kids on twitter but he failed. 

>He said ""you could just see the strain on his face that third year on the Warriors. He was staring at that phone all the time."" So he can't get over this, he's out here having GOAT ""top 5"" debates, trying to make sure he's in that conversation on twitter. He says he's over it but he's not. And I don't think he's really changed since the Bay. The only difference is Brooklyn lets him be him and doesn't get in his face like Kerr did.

That should be more interesting than what I do on Twitter.","https://redd.it/of05zq",10297909,1625593865000,"[]","{""url"":null}",,,"{""name"":""r/nba | 4033109 Subscribers"",""iconURL"":""https://cdn.discordapp.com/avatars/799722126784725042/5de289dd938456254174b76c8e75f01d.webp""}",,"{""text"":""[Self Post by /u/GuyCarbonneauGOAT] | [8752 👍] | [0 👎 ] | [1368 📃]""}","[]"
