As ESPN grapples with internal turmoil that threatens to overshadow its NBA Finals coverage, Adam Silver gave a clear endorsement of embattled reporter Rachel Nichols.

Speaking at a news conference prior to Game 1 of the NBA Finals Tuesday, Silver was asked his thoughts on the tumult that surfaced from a New York Times story surrounding leaked comments made by Nichols, who is white, regarding diversity at ESPN and her colleague Maria Taylor, who is Black.

After describing the incident as ""disheartening,"" Silver told reporters that he doesn't believe a professional with an established track record and good reputation should have her career ""erased by a single comment."" Silver said that he's worked through similar issues in the NBA by ""getting people in a room and working through these issues by talking a lot about them.""

> ""They require a very labor-intensive effort ... creating a climate where people are comfortable saying what’s on their mind, where people are given the benefit of the doubt, especially long-term employees that are in good standing that when they do make comments that people recognize that people make mistakes — that careers shouldn’t be erased by a single comment,"" Silver said. 

> ""That we should be judging people by the larger context of their body of work and who they are and what we know about them.""","https://redd.it/ofiqnz",10297909,1625663973000,"[]","{""url"":null}",,,"{""name"":""r/nba | 4033298 Subscribers"",""iconURL"":""https://cdn.discordapp.com/avatars/799722126784725042/5de289dd938456254174b76c8e75f01d.webp""}",,"{""text"":""[Self Post by /u/nonbiasednbafan] | [6386 👍] | [0 👎 ] | [2240 📃]""}","[]"
