I know this is probably a post more appropriate for the offseason than the middle of the conference finals, but I just had to share.

Wolves fans are (rightfully so) enamored with Ant, but he’s not the only rookie that fans are gushing about. I don’t think it’s a stretch to say his upside is an all-defensive caliber defender.

You can just tell he has *it*. His defensive instincts are insane. He knows the right angles to take, knows how/when to use his body and when to let the defender come to him, knows when to be active with his hands. He’s aggressive/fearless contesting at the rim and knows how to time his block attempts really well. He’s got the athleticism, length (6’11 wing span), and foot speed to stay in front of pretty much anybody. And on top of being a great on-ball defender, he’s been a brilliant help and weak-side defender as well. 

I mean, to be a 190-pound rookie who can go one-on-one in the paint with Zion and also be a complete pest to guys like Luka or Harden on perimeter is pretty remarkable. 

To add to all this, he’s got nice shooting mechanics and can already knock down 3s at a pretty reliable pace (36% on the season), *and* he’s shown flashes of being able to create his own shot. He’s still incredibly raw, but the talent seems to be there. 

The 2020 NBA draft could potentially end up being a huge difference-maker for the Wolves.","https://redd.it/ob4nfk",10297909,1625081464000,"[]","{""url"":null}",,,"{""name"":""r/nba | 4020989 Subscribers"",""iconURL"":""https://cdn.discordapp.com/avatars/799722126784725042/5de289dd938456254174b76c8e75f01d.webp""}",,"{""text"":""[Self Post by /u/EsotericPotato] | [30 👍] | [0 👎 ] | [16 📃]""}","[]"
