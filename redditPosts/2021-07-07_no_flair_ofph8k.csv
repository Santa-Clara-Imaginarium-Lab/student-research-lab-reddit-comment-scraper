"rich","NBA Star Tiers Breakdown","I keep encountering discussions on what makes a star, or what defines a superstar in the NBA. So I decided to take a crack at what I consider to be the tiers within basketball's 'star spectrum'. They are as follows:

**Superstars:**

Top ten talents with celebrity power/magnetism and cultural cach√©/recognition. They have their own shoes. They are recognized outside North America. They have huge social followings and sports broadcasters talk about them even when there's nothing to talk about.

LeBron, Curry, Kawhi, Durant, Giannis, Doncic\*

\*Giving Doncic the benefit of the doubt here as I think the Olympics will cement his superstar status.

**Stars:**

Top 25 talents that are not only elite players but also have some star power. They may or may not have their own signature shoe, but most will have large social followings.

Lillard, Jokic\*, Irving, Trae, Paul George, Westbrook, Morant, Booker, Anthony Davis, Chris Paul, Mitchell, Harden, Embiid, Draymond Green, Jimmy Butler

\*I think if Jokic hired some savvy social types to run his IG/Twitter etc he would be superstar level, but his lack of interest in self-marketing (which is totally ok and actually refreshing) bumps him down a notch here.

**Rising stars:**

Young or young-ish players that are currently hard to place on the star spectrum because their position isn't quite solidified yet and/or they have recently started to show star potential. They could end up being superstars, regular stars or just solid players.

Zion\*, Jaylen Brown, Tatum, Randle, Abedayo, LaMelo Ball, Lavine, KAT, Ayton, Barrett

\*For instance, I think Zion is already likely at star level, but could very well be a superstar next year.

**Elite without star power:**

Really good players who don't have 'star power' or have faded from star level with time.

Beal, Jrue Holiday, DeRozen, Gobert, Ben Simmons, Carmelo Anthony, Kyle Lowry, Middleton, Rose, Valanciunus.

I probably missed a bunch of people, tell me your thoughts and hate away.
