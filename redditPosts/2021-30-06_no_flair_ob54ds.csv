"rich","Why were the prime Spurs teams considered “boring”?","Rewatching clips of the Big 3 Spurs era, I have no clue how you could call their play style boring in any way. They had some of the best playmaking and ball movement abilities of any team in NBA history IMO. Some of the plays they were able to pull off were insane. Tony Parker consistently pulled off some of the most athletic shots you’ll ever see and Manu’s ability to make something out of nothing literally changed the way offense was treated in the NBA.","https://redd.it/ob54ds",10297909,1625082811000,"[]","{""url"":null}",,,"{""name"":""r/nba | 4020999 Subscribers"",""iconURL"":""https://cdn.discordapp.com/avatars/799722126784725042/5de289dd938456254174b76c8e75f01d.webp""}",,"{""text"":""[Self Post by /u/EAH141] | [10 👍] | [0 👎 ] | [66 📃]""}","[]"
