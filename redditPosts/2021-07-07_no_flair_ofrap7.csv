"rich","How did you first learn about the NBA past your local team?","[Kobe Bryant in NBA Courtside](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WbPL-97ZClc&t=218s) for the Nintendo 64 literally taught me the NBA back in 1998/1999. I would load it up and see all these teams I had never heard of before. At school I would only ever hear about the Suns, Lakers, Bulls, and Jazz (I even had a Bulls jacket and Stockton/Malone posters). But then I would play this game and see teams like the ""Magic"" and ""Raptors"" and wonder if the Suns ever played against them too.  I would hear players names for the first time. I heard the announcer say ""Jason Kidd with the assist"" so many times that it annoyed me because I didn't know what it meant yet. I didn't get to actually go to games as a kid and rarely got to watch them on TV so this video game had a huge impact on me. 

I'm guessing Space Jam would be a common answer to this question too.","https://redd.it/ofrap7",10297909,1625689466000,"[]","{""url"":null}",,,"{""name"":""r/nba | 4033299 Subscribers"",""iconURL"":""https://cdn.discordapp.com/avatars/799722126784725042/5de289dd938456254174b76c8e75f01d.webp""}",,"{""text"":""[Self Post by /u/deadwinged] | [1 👍] | [0 👎 ] | [0 📃]""}","[]"
