&nbsp;

A recent example you could look to is the Atlanta Hawks. You could call their 2018 season their first ""tanking/rebuilding season"", and 3 years later they make it to the ECF and push it to 6 games with their star player getting injured midway through the series.  This is what I would consider a fast rebuild, but by no means the limit. 

&nbsp;

Some teams seem to be in a perpetual state of rebuilding, and some in a perpetual state of competing.  **I believe 5 years is the absolute limit on acceptable time of a rebuild** (4 is pushing it, but I'd accept 5 if I had to), with 3 being the fastest that you can do a proper rebuild. I don't believe you can rebuild a team in 1-2 years, if you bounce back that quickly you either just had injures or swapped some pieces around which isn't what I would view as a rebuild.  Curious to see what people think.","https://redd.it/ofr692",10297909,1625689093000,"[]","{""url"":null}",,,"{""name"":""r/nba | 4033299 Subscribers"",""iconURL"":""https://cdn.discordapp.com/avatars/799722126784725042/5de289dd938456254174b76c8e75f01d.webp""}",,"{""text"":""[Self Post by /u/Regex00] | [2 👍] | [0 👎 ] | [10 📃]""}","[]"
