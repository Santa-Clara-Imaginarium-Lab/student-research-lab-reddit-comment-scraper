"rich","Who on Team USA gets the last shot to win the game?","In this hypothetical, let's say team USA is down 2 and they need a 3 to win the game and a 2 to go to OT, who are they giving the ball to?

Team USA has a lot of talented players and this would probably be a difficult situation as these players are used to being the mans on their own team and stuff

Who do you think should be the one taking the last shot for team USA?","https://redd.it/ofph84",10297909,1625684079000,"[]","{""url"":null}",,,"{""name"":""r/nba | 4033298 Subscribers"",""iconURL"":""https://cdn.discordapp.com/avatars/799722126784725042/5de289dd938456254174b76c8e75f01d.webp""}",,"{""text"":""[Self Post by /u/Lord_CommanderKyrie7] | [14 👍] | [0 👎 ] | [65 📃]""}","[]"
