>He’s not a big social media guy.

>Still, some of the criticism found its way to Hawks rookie Onyeka Okongwu — it came harsh and swift, as online judgment so often does.

>“On Twitter, Instagram, people were tagging me saying, ‘O’s a bust, Okongwu’s a bust, right?’ Okongwu said. “And I’m just looking at my phone like, ‘Damn, already?’”

>How that tune has changed in about five months.

>“I told myself people are going to end up going back one day and deleting all those tweets,” the Hawks’ No. 6 overall draft pick in 2020 said with a smile, one day after battling well and bringing the energy in the Hawks’ Game 4 win against the Milwaukee, which evened the Eastern Conference Finals at 2-2. “... I don’t really feed into it because the Hawks know what I bring to the table, I know what I bring to the table,” Okongwu said. “People are always going to talk. And hopefully, I can silence the haters one day.”

>At 20 years old, Okongwu already has set that path in motion, his game blossoming on this scrappy postseason run.

>He has played key minutes for the Hawks behind center Clint Capela, throwing down dunks, showing his defensive abilities on Giannis Antetokounmpo, adjusting on the angle of screens, the timing of rolling to the basket and making different reads if teams front the post.","https://redd.it/ob6oph",10297909,1625087483000,"[]","{""url"":null}",,,"{""name"":""r/nba | 4021127 Subscribers"",""iconURL"":""https://cdn.discordapp.com/avatars/799722126784725042/5de289dd938456254174b76c8e75f01d.webp""}",,"{""text"":""[Self Post by /u/GuyCarbonneauGOAT] | [163 👍] | [0 👎 ] | [59 📃]""}","[]"
