"rich","Giannis’ supporting cast vs Lebron’s in Cleveland (2015-2017)","I think Giannis has the better supporting cast but it’s close.          
IMO:        
Middleton + Jrue > Kyrie.         
Lopez > Love.         
Cavs has the better shooters no doubt but Giannis supporting cast is more complete.           
Kevin Love was a nonfactor in Cleveland","https://redd.it/ofr5xq",10297909,1625689064000,"[]","{""url"":null}",,,"{""name"":""r/nba | 4033299 Subscribers"",""iconURL"":""https://cdn.discordapp.com/avatars/799722126784725042/5de289dd938456254174b76c8e75f01d.webp""}",,"{""text"":""[Self Post by /u/dkkdjjfmfkf] | [0 👍] | [0 👎 ] | [9 📃]""}","[]"
