But generally they like guys who show up in shape and play hard.  Avoid long passes down court unless it's wide open.  Move without the ball by cutting to the basket as well as getting open for a jumper.  They also like guys who have played organized ball in the past.  It's just easier to coordinate practices.  Try to get an idea how practices and tryouts went the previous year with the coach.  Winning the wind sprints - or finishing well - helps out a lot.   Also, everyone trying out will be nervous whether they admit it or not.  Don't get too concerned about things that mess up.  Try to put them behind you and remain focused and engaged.  The coach will probably already have a good idea who he is keeping.   Show you can keep up in practice, you can learn drills quickly and you are in shape.  There will probably be a good number of guys who do not show back up day #2.

One was the star of a low-end D1 team that made the tournament and led the team in nearly every statistical category. One was a starter on a P5 and played in the G League.

"Basketball","G2_Parejko","Should I change my shooting hand?","Hey so I've been in a bit of a dilemma recently. I have been playing basketball for 10 years. When I was a kid, I shot two handed especially from mid range and three until I was like 13 or 14, with using my left more than my right when I shot. Eventually at 14, my form became a one motion shot primarily involving my left hand shooting the ball and my right hand being a guide hand. I have developed strong muscle memory since then and it does sort of feel natural to shoot with my left hand up until now, and im 18. But the thing is... I'm right handed in my everyday life. It is my stronger arm. I write with it. I told someone I shoot with my left even though I'm right handed and they told me it was unnecessary. I normally go for right hand floaters and layups because they feel easier--more natural for me. I'm just stuck on whether I should change my shooting hand if it will make it easier to shoot or allow me to shoot from farther later on in my life. Should I change my shooting hand to my right? Or keep it left?","t3_ofsqnb","https://www.reddit.com/r/Basketball/comments/ofsqnb/should_i_change_my_shooting_hand/",3,"t1_h4eksi5","2021-07-07 2:58:52 PM","Ben, get yourself a proper shooting coach instead of asking randoms on reddit",8,0,1,0,0,5

"nbacirclejerk","SeatleSuperbSonics","Kyrie Irving stole my CitiBike","

This happened just before Kyrie signed with the Nets. I was riding around on a Citibike in Brooklyn and as I was docking the bike to reset my 45 minute timer, I saw Kyrie curiously looking at the bikes. He noticed I put the bike in, used my key and got my bike back out.

He asked me “hey man do you know how this works?”.

I was a bit too excited and accidentally called him Kylie but he didn’t notice. I explained to him the basic rules of CitiBike but he kept acting like it was too complicated and didn’t make sense.

“So why did you put the bike back in just to take it out?”he asked

I told him “that’s because of the timer I mentioned to you. You have to return the bike before the time is up to avoid extra charges. You’re free to reset the time by docking it again”

He looked quite puzzled and asked if he could use my bike to test it out.

I told him all he needs to do is use a card and he can just get his own bike.

He refused and said he just wanted to try it out, hot but the bike.

Getting kind of annoyed I was like “dude it’s $3 for a bike”

He snapped back at me and said “if it’s only $3 why won’t you let me use yours?”

I said fuck it what’s the worst that can happen? So I let him hop on my CitiBike. This fucking guy gets on and starts strolling away and suddenly fucking guns t. I’ve never seen someone fast in my life.

I waited there for about 30 minutes but he never returned. I tried to call CitiBike and tell them what happened but they said allowing other people to use the bike is my responsibility.

After 45 minutes I got charged a late fee .. then again .. then a day fee ... the charges stopped but this morning I just woke up to a $1,200 charge on my account!! My credit card only has a $500 dollar limit but these fuckers somehow still charged me and now my credit usage is like 300%.

"CollegeBasketball","SolitonSnake","Interactive ""Power Projection"" Map","I love checking up on the imperialism maps / the ""remaining undefeated teams"" maps throughout the season, so I've been working on my own version for the coming 2021-22 season: the [CBB ""Power Projection"" Map](https://imgur.com/urkj2Pg) (currently using the latest data from the end of the 2021 season).

In this map, each US county is assigned an ""owner"" based on who has the highest power projection score in that county. This score is calculated for each team in each county by taking their Kenpom Adj. EM and dividing it by the distance between the team's stadium and the nearest county border -- the result is that each county is controlled by the strongest nearby team, allowing teams to expand and protect their ""domain"" by playing better (and thus raising their Adj. EM throughout the season). In order to avoid making it too cluttered, I also imposed a rule that only the top 30 teams (by Adj. EM) could own land; this is pretty arbitrary though so if you think it should be different let me know. 

You can explore the map (and see which non-landed teams are within each team's domain) using this interactive version I made:

> https://werdna63.shinyapps.io/ncaa-maps/#section-power-projection-map

(It should work on mobile, but it's probably going to look a lot better on a desktop / laptop)

It also includes a data viewing tool that lets you view the total land area, water area, population, etc. of each team's ""domain"" (you can even export the tables to a .CSV or a .PDF!). It should update automatically after each game since it draws the data directly from Kenpom.com too!

I'm posting this here now because I wanted to see if anyone had any feedback / recommendations for how I could improve this before the season starts; I also might throw something similar together for college football since that's coming up even sooner. If this is something you think would be fun / if you have any feedback it would be appreciated!","t3_ogz54c","https://www.reddit.com/r/CollegeBasketball/comments/ogz54c/interactive_power_projection_map/",22,"t1_h4masnx","2021-09-07 11:32:08 AM","Just made a dumbass comment thinking this was the football sub, hope no one saw it before I deleted lol",2,0.227,0.549,0.224,-0.0258,3.74

I mean, a line up of Payton, Kobe, Fox, Malone, and Shaq with Fisher and Grant coming off the bench is pretty dang solid. There’s also a couple Sixers teams from the 80’s that have impressive rosters. There’s one with Mo cheeks, Dr. J, Barkley, Moses Malone, and Bob McAdoo and one with World B.

"nbadiscussion","hashbrown17","Ranking OKC's First Round Picks","Everyone knows that OKC has a lot of draft capital. While it is typically reported that they have 17 FRPs over the next 7 years, they realistically have 18 since it is unlikely that their own 2022 FRP that they owe to Atlanta (lottery protected) will convey. Presti will certainly look to end up in the lottery again next year, which means that FRP will be retained and they will send out 2 of their 21 SRPs instead.

And the big reason that we can be certain that OKC will try to keep it in house is that it may well be the last 'good' chance they have to get a high-calibre pick that can be assured to draft in the top-10, which is where teams want to be in order to maximize their chances of getting a superstar through the draft.

Could that possibly be right?!? With so many future FRPs, the assumption would be that there will be lots of ping pong balls in the Thunder's future. But unless the Clippers or Philadelphia fall apart completely or Houston's rebuild takes longer than the Rockets hope, then OKC may well have nothing but their own picks to rely upon for a lottery presence; and with Shai in hand and an eye on hopefully taking advantage of future swap rights, one would expect that they try to stop tanking sooner rather than later (not to mention ownership and fans surely won't be happy if the rebuild starts to extend for too long).

Let's look at exactly what future FRPs the Thunder have and try to rank them into 3 tiers: Likely top-10 picks, likely mid-first picks (10-20), and likely late-first picks (20-30).

# Likely top-10 selections 

Here are the money picks:

2021 OKC - pick 6

2022 OKC - (lottery protected FRP currently owned by ATL)

**WHAT?** Is that seriously it?! You may disagree with my ranks, but I'm using ""likely"" as literally as possible. I'm not going to assume that the Clippers are ""likely"" to be horrible in 2024 or 2026. It is certainly possible that they could collapse and end up in the lottery, but as long as Ballmer is willing to spend and the franchise remains in LA with good management, I can't help but think they will find a way to remain 'playoff-competitive' at least.

The same is true for Philadelphia's 2025 FRP. They may well fall apart completely and not be able to stay within their protections (top 6 in '25, top 4 in '26, top 4 in '27), but Daryl Morey has always been good at his job and even with Embiid's injury concerns, I can't buy in to the idea that a top-10 selection is ""likely"". And if it does happen, it clearly won't be better than pick 5, which sort of mitigates the chances of getting a superstar at that spot.

The only other non-OKC chances that exist at a top-10 pick come from Houston's 2024 and 2026 selections. Considering where Houston is now, these may be the best chance the Thunder have, but by adding the second pick in a loaded draft to an already competitive young core, there is not a ""likely"" chance that these top-4 protected picks end up top 10. And if they do, it would probably be at the very tail end of that range. Losing out on this year's pick swap, which seemed to be just a free 48% shot at a superstar, may have been even worse than it looks at first glance if a guy like Jalen Green or Evan Mobley can pull Houston into the play-in tournament in a few years. But while I don't feel comfortable consigning these picks to this tier, they will absolutely appear high in the next one.

# Likely mid-first round picks

2021 BOS pick 16

2021 MIA pick 18

Obviously these two are already locked in to this range. Unlikely to see a future superstar come from these picks, but if Presti holds on to them (instead of using them in trades) there is a chance they could get a decent player or 2 given how deep this year's draft is. 

These future picks are in the order of which ones I am predicting to be the 'best' picks.

2023 OKC (unlikely swap with LAC)

2024 OKC

2024 HOU 

2025 PHI

2026 LAC

2023 MIA

2026 HOU

2024 LAC

Let's sub-divide this tier right here for a moment to talk about it. I'm assuming that OKC wants to start climbing out of the cellar by this point and has enough of a team to successfully do it considering how competitive they were this year before the tank was initiated. They likely want to get good to keep everyone happy and give fans some hope, as well as to take advantage of some of the swaps they have on future picks. But they certainly aren't likely to be a good team at this point. I don't see them being able to take advantage of the 2023 swap with the Clippers. These picks will probably land somewhere between 10-16, imo.

The Philly pick is one of the hardest to forecast. I'll drop it here, but I'm interested in what other people think about it.

As mentioned in the previous tier's final paragraph, Houston may not get to rebuild as quickly as they want to and this pick could still fall in the lottery. But there is absolutely no guarantee of that. and even less of a guarantee on the 2026 pick. 

For the unprotected Clippers picks, the chances of being high-quality go in reverse order as their stars age out. The 2026 pick may well be a gold mine. It could very well be the number 1 overall pick. PG and Kawhi will be quite old at this point if they are even still on the team, but if they aren't, there is a good chance that other stars will have lined up to play in Los Angeles for a really good owner. 

I'm projecting the Miami pick to be similar to what it was this year... late teens. Let me know if you disagree. Which means those 2 picks after it could very well end up in the next tier.

# Likely late-first round picks

So maybe those 2024 LAC and 2026 HOU picks will end up in the 20s somewhere, but I put them there in order to give OKC the benefit of the doubt. And I'll give them the benefit of the doubt here with their own picks. If all goes well, they should have had enough time to get into the playoffs again, but their own picks from 2025 on may well still be in the teens. Because as we are seeing... they really don't have a lot of great opportunities to draft stars unless they get lucky on some of their mid-first selections. It's very possible they don't escape mediocrity. But let's give them the benefit of the doubt that SGA becomes a top-20 player and Poku doesn't bust and say they have climbed into semi-contention by 2025.

2025 OKC (possible unprotected swap with LAC or HOU, top-10 protected)

2026 OKC

2027 OKC

2023 DEN (unlikely to be used lottery protection)

2022 LAC

2022 PHO (unlikely to be used protections)

So they have 3 picks coming up in the next couple years from teams that project to be very good. These picks are almost certain to land well after 20.

# Conclusion

So that's all 18 picks. I think I was pretty fair in my analysis (feel free to disagree), and if so it means that despite a great deal of quantity... I'm not seeing a whole lot of quality in OKC's pick futures. Outside of their own picks, there aren't any sure-fire top picks. In fact, ***there may not be a single lottery pick from another team in the whole bunch.***

Losing the final game of the season to the Clippers as well as the 'coin-flip' on the Houston swap may have really killed their chances to draft a generational superstar.

Even if they wanted to package picks to move up, they may not have enough juice to get very high in the draft simply because they might not have a good starting spot to bargain with after the next couple of years.

Presti will have to draft well from the middle of the draft, because those valuable top-4 selections that got the Thunder 3 MVPs so many years ago don't seem to be on the horizon.

"nbadiscussion","machin576","Ranking OKC's First Round Picks","Everyone knows that OKC has a lot of draft capital. While it is typically reported that they have 17 FRPs over the next 7 years, they realistically have 18 since it is unlikely that their own 2022 FRP that they owe to Atlanta (lottery protected) will convey. Presti will certainly look to end up in the lottery again next year, which means that FRP will be retained and they will send out 2 of their 21 SRPs instead.

And the big reason that we can be certain that OKC will try to keep it in house is that it may well be the last 'good' chance they have to get a high-calibre pick that can be assured to draft in the top-10, which is where teams want to be in order to maximize their chances of getting a superstar through the draft.

Could that possibly be right?!? With so many future FRPs, the assumption would be that there will be lots of ping pong balls in the Thunder's future. But unless the Clippers or Philadelphia fall apart completely or Houston's rebuild takes longer than the Rockets hope, then OKC may well have nothing but their own picks to rely upon for a lottery presence; and with Shai in hand and an eye on hopefully taking advantage of future swap rights, one would expect that they try to stop tanking sooner rather than later (not to mention ownership and fans surely won't be happy if the rebuild starts to extend for too long).

Let's look at exactly what future FRPs the Thunder have and try to rank them into 3 tiers: Likely top-10 picks, likely mid-first picks (10-20), and likely late-first picks (20-30).

# Likely top-10 selections 

Here are the money picks:

2021 OKC - pick 6

2022 OKC - (lottery protected FRP currently owned by ATL)

**WHAT?** Is that seriously it?! You may disagree with my ranks, but I'm using ""likely"" as literally as possible. I'm not going to assume that the Clippers are ""likely"" to be horrible in 2024 or 2026. It is certainly possible that they could collapse and end up in the lottery, but as long as Ballmer is willing to spend and the franchise remains in LA with good management, I can't help but think they will find a way to remain 'playoff-competitive' at least.

The same is true for Philadelphia's 2025 FRP. They may well fall apart completely and not be able to stay within their protections (top 6 in '25, top 4 in '26, top 4 in '27), but Daryl Morey has always been good at his job and even with Embiid's injury concerns, I can't buy in to the idea that a top-10 selection is ""likely"". And if it does happen, it clearly won't be better than pick 5, which sort of mitigates the chances of getting a superstar at that spot.

The only other non-OKC chances that exist at a top-10 pick come from Houston's 2024 and 2026 selections. Considering where Houston is now, these may be the best chance the Thunder have, but by adding the second pick in a loaded draft to an already competitive young core, there is not a ""likely"" chance that these top-4 protected picks end up top 10. And if they do, it would probably be at the very tail end of that range. Losing out on this year's pick swap, which seemed to be just a free 48% shot at a superstar, may have been even worse than it looks at first glance if a guy like Jalen Green or Evan Mobley can pull Houston into the play-in tournament in a few years. But while I don't feel comfortable consigning these picks to this tier, they will absolutely appear high in the next one.

# Likely mid-first round picks

2021 BOS pick 16

2021 MIA pick 18

Obviously these two are already locked in to this range. Unlikely to see a future superstar come from these picks, but if Presti holds on to them (instead of using them in trades) there is a chance they could get a decent player or 2 given how deep this year's draft is. 

These future picks are in the order of which ones I am predicting to be the 'best' picks.

2023 OKC (unlikely swap with LAC)

2024 OKC

2024 HOU 

2025 PHI

2026 LAC

2023 MIA

2026 HOU

2024 LAC

Let's sub-divide this tier right here for a moment to talk about it. I'm assuming that OKC wants to start climbing out of the cellar by this point and has enough of a team to successfully do it considering how competitive they were this year before the tank was initiated. They likely want to get good to keep everyone happy and give fans some hope, as well as to take advantage of some of the swaps they have on future picks. But they certainly aren't likely to be a good team at this point. I don't see them being able to take advantage of the 2023 swap with the Clippers. These picks will probably land somewhere between 10-16, imo.

The Philly pick is one of the hardest to forecast. I'll drop it here, but I'm interested in what other people think about it.

As mentioned in the previous tier's final paragraph, Houston may not get to rebuild as quickly as they want to and this pick could still fall in the lottery. But there is absolutely no guarantee of that. and even less of a guarantee on the 2026 pick. 

For the unprotected Clippers picks, the chances of being high-quality go in reverse order as their stars age out. The 2026 pick may well be a gold mine. It could very well be the number 1 overall pick. PG and Kawhi will be quite old at this point if they are even still on the team, but if they aren't, there is a good chance that other stars will have lined up to play in Los Angeles for a really good owner. 

I'm projecting the Miami pick to be similar to what it was this year... late teens. Let me know if you disagree. Which means those 2 picks after it could very well end up in the next tier.

# Likely late-first round picks

So maybe those 2024 LAC and 2026 HOU picks will end up in the 20s somewhere, but I put them there in order to give OKC the benefit of the doubt. And I'll give them the benefit of the doubt here with their own picks. If all goes well, they should have had enough time to get into the playoffs again, but their own picks from 2025 on may well still be in the teens. Because as we are seeing... they really don't have a lot of great opportunities to draft stars unless they get lucky on some of their mid-first selections. It's very possible they don't escape mediocrity. But let's give them the benefit of the doubt that SGA becomes a top-20 player and Poku doesn't bust and say they have climbed into semi-contention by 2025.

2025 OKC (possible unprotected swap with LAC or HOU, top-10 protected)

2026 OKC

2027 OKC

2023 DEN (unlikely to be used lottery protection)

2022 LAC

2022 PHO (unlikely to be used protections)

So they have 3 picks coming up in the next couple years from teams that project to be very good. These picks are almost certain to land well after 20.

# Conclusion

So that's all 18 picks. I think I was pretty fair in my analysis (feel free to disagree), and if so it means that despite a great deal of quantity... I'm not seeing a whole lot of quality in OKC's pick futures. Outside of their own picks, there aren't any sure-fire top picks. In fact, ***there may not be a single lottery pick from another team in the whole bunch.***

Losing the final game of the season to the Clippers as well as the 'coin-flip' on the Houston swap may have really killed their chances to draft a generational superstar.

Even if they wanted to package picks to move up, they may not have enough juice to get very high in the draft simply because they might not have a good starting spot to bargain with after the next couple of years.

Presti will have to draft well from the middle of the draft, because those valuable top-4 selections that got the Thunder 3 MVPs so many years ago don't seem to be on the horizon.

2009-2010 was a season in which he didn't shoot threes at all.

35.4 minutes per game in 81 games, and he attempted only seven three-pointers on the season. He took 58.0% of his FGA in the restricted area, and 74.0% of his FGA in the paint overall.

That was his best season in WS, WS/48, BPM, and VORP. It was also about tied for his best season in PER and TS%.

He averaged 15.7 points, 8.7 rebounds, 4.2 assists, 1.6 steals, 2.1 blocks, and had a .536 TS%. He was second in DPOY voting that year. The Hawks were a plus-7.1 with him on the floor, and were better with him on the floor than off on both offense and defense.

"nbadiscussion","ID_11","How do you use the postseason vs. the regular season to evaluate players or coaches?","I've noticed a reasonable discrepancy in the way fans/commentators value players vs. the way they value coaches. For instance, there is a huge group of people that defend players like Westbrook, Giannis and Gobert despite the fact that they have come up short of expectations in the playoffs. Coaches such as Dwane Casey and Budenholzer were both very successful regular season coaches that came up short of expectations in the playoffs and have received almost unanimous disapproval because of their post season struggles. We can't forget that Bud was the coach of the year in 2015 and 2019 both years when he took different teams from mediocre eastern conference teams to 1st seeds. 

Just to be clear, I put A LOT of value in the playoffs. I love play off basketball, and the teams I route for I don't want to just have a great regular season followed by a 1st round exit. 

Does this have to do with the way fans relate to players vs. the way they relate to coaches?

Or is it more about the fact that you can help if a player has short comings you can surround him with teammates that are capable of compensating, where as coaches are a more solitary entity?","t3_o73un3","https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/o73un3/how_do_you_use_the_postseason_vs_the_regular/",4,"t1_h2wouwg","2021-24-06 10:33:35 AM","I think the ability to surround a player with help partially contributes to that. I think it also boils down to the fact that a coach's playoff adjustments' success seems pretty binary to the average fan -- it either works or doesn't. Taking the players you mentioned into account, all three of those guys have had perimeter-centric All-Stars who can create this ""gray area."" If someone else plays well (and even if the team loses), they just won't receive as much flak because it wasn't totally explicit and got overshadowed. For Gobert, I think Game 1 of the West semis was a great example of this. He struggled on offense and mostly had a limited defensive impact unlike his dominance in the regular season. But he got the game-winning block and Mitchell dropped 45, so his struggles just weren't as apparent. Then look at Bud, who got a ton of criticism even after beating the Nets in Game 7. The play he drew up at the end of regulation which ended in that horrible fadeaway baseline shot was entirely on him. Why? Because in a fan's eyes he's the singular guy in charge. Without anyone else visibly at his position (a star has teammates, a coach doesn't have a co-head coach), there's no other place to distribute blame that stems from a sideline mistake. A player on the other hand, isn't supposed to be ""the guy in charge."" If that were truly the case, they would probably (and rightfully) get the benefit of the doubt from not having any help.  I'm a Knicks fan and I'm seeing that with the Julius Randle hate starting to die down.",6,0.13,0.738,0.132,-0.1372,6.32

With the young Atlanta team coming up 2 wins short of the finals in their first year of competing in the playoffs, they have rightfully earned a lot of praise for their rebuild. While right now Hawks fans might feel disappointment from the elimination, there’s plenty of reason to be optimistic about the near future. Let’s take a look at how their cap table looks going forward and how they can keep the team together.

The Hawks currently have ~93.5 million committed for 2021-2022. John Collins has a cap hold of $12,411,906, so unless they renounce his rights, that brings them to ~105.9 million committed for 2021-2022.

**So currently, the Hawks are set to have around 6 million to work with in cap space this summer. This number rises to about 11 million if Kris Dunn declines his player option.**

They can use this space to bring back veterans like Williams, Hill, and Snell, or sign a free agent to bring someone new in.

**They will have to be strategic about how to use that space, however, as a long term deal might not be feasible.** If we assume that Atlanta has to offer a max contract to keep Collins and they also extend Trae at the max, their payroll gets pretty packed pretty fast. Let's take a look at their payroll for players expected to be part of the future.

^(*Italics indicate future estimation*)

So they’ll have some tough decisions next summer since they’ll likely have 141.4 million committed to just 9 players for 2022-2023 with Kevin Huerter needing to be re-signed on top of that. Extending Huerter this offseason is an option, but Atlanta’s front office might hesitate after committing so much to Trae and Collins. Plus, Capela, Hunter, and Reddish will all be up for new deals in 2023. This gets a little easier if they can retain Collins for less than the max, but that is yet to be seen of course. If worst comes to worst and they don't want to pay him so much, then they can still re-sign him and move him later since the cap consequences don't hit them hard until 2023.

Moving Gallinari’s contract next summer would save them 21.5 million for that year, so if they do need to duck below the tax it can be done without too much struggle. Another option to to deal with the high pay-roll would be to consolidate 2-3 of their good young players into one star sometime in the next few years. I thought about exploring some ways that they could open up a max slot for a big free agent, but it would likely require moving too many core pieces to be realistic and worth it. However, with all the young talent on the team set to be on reasonable deals, sign-and-trades will be a possibility going forward.

What do you guys think? How should Atlanta's front office handle their cap situation in the coming years? I think that they have flexibility to keep a great team together, but they will have to get creative as their rookie deals expire.","t3_odls7z","https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/odls7z/taking_a_look_at_the_atlanta_hawks_cap_situation/",382,"t1_h4225fx","2021-04-07 12:58:56 PM","The core 3 are Trae, Collins, and as much as I'd wanna say Reddish/Huerter, it's Capela.

But, from my eyes, I feel like the Bucks' overall team strategy is flawed and with the emergence of other teams in the East, Milwaukee's window will close fast. Here is what I see. I wanted to see if you guys agree with me.

1. Giannis is a Center. He's like a better version of Ayton in Phoenix. Giannis should not be the focal point of the offence. He's too limited. I say move him to the 5 and find shooting 4 that can spread the floor for Giannis in transition but can also rebound down low. Move Lopez to bench or trade?
2. Chris Middleton- I think he might be a better player than he is showing. I would make him a featured option. I think the consistency of being a #1 will do wonders for his game.
3. Jrue Holiday. I love him as a player. His defense is amazing. Did you see him block Ayton's dunk straight up?  I do think the Bucks are asking him to do too much offensively. I would move Jrue to the 2 and bring in an aggressive minded scoring guard to offset.
4. New Coach. Need I say more?

I don't thing they need to spend a lot to get these players. It would round out the team.

Giannis does have some limitations but it takes either an elite big man defender with strength and quickness to guard him, or you need to form a wall with multiple defenders. You have to gameplan your entire defense around him. He may not be suited as the “closer” but he’s been dominant these playoffs, he can absolutely be the primary scorer. The adjustment I think his game needs is to move him off ball more and utilize him as a screener/cutter more often, and also improve his midrange game to prevent teams from just forming a wall. Of course that would require having more playmakers on the team, which they don’t have.  Khris isn’t consistent enough to be a #1, he’s better suited as a secondary scorer and closer.  I agree on Jrue, his best seasons have been when he’s had another guard to share playmaking responsibilities with, he’s more of a secondary playmaker than a primary.  I do think they could use a better coach but that’s a lot easier said than done; Bud’s not elite but he’s absolutely a good coach.",1,0.009,0.784,0.207,0.9909,3.57

What I take away from them being so close to making it to the Eastern Conference Finals is that, The 76ers franchise does not need a complete overhaul just a change in a weak part of their foundation, which happens to be Ben Simmons.

The answer I think to this problem is Lonzo Ball. The two have very similar skill sets on both sides of the ball. Pass first,elite ball vision, transition scoring,bigger guards, lockdown perimeter defense, great rebounding etc but Lonzo is a lot better at the things that we blame Ben Simmons for in blowing the Atlanta hawks series. Which are freethrow shooting and floor spacing from 3.

I also think Lonzo Ball would bring a much more passionate approach to the game which would rub off on his teammates in a positive manner and also he has added to his basketball skills  and gotten better every year.

"nbadiscussion","drtij_dzienz","These playoffs are really showing some other strengths besides player talent","Let me preface this by saying that it does suck that all these stars are/have gone down and not played playoff games.






philosophically I've always felt that the 7 game series format for so many rounds, is built to make sure the best teams win.  I think it breaks down in to 3 main parts of a team that are shown in the playoffs.  




1) the skill level, clutchness, talent of your major stars.  I think this is what most of the viewers are watching for most years.  guys who can make shots towards the end of games, guys who can dominate, score, rebound, make highlights, get everyone pumped.  Guys like Dame, Luca, etc dominate in these fields.  But you can't do it alone in this space.  just look at some of the most talented teams in history not winning a chip.  For me, the greatest examples are teams like the Lakers with malone and payton.  The first year heatles.  which brings us to:



2) coaching.  which is so much easier to see when it's deficient than when it is working super well.  Coaching makes your team work together. Coaching is shown in how well your team is prepped, how you manage the game, call time outs, make adjustments during a game and between games.  How you motivate your players.  When it's deficient, you get things like Doc Rivers losing 3-1 series leads for not making adjustments.  But you need something beyond just super talented players, and great coaching.  You need:



3) a really good talented strong front office (and maybe owner with money or who understands their role).  I think this year more than any, the front office work is really showing.  With stars going down left and right, a lot of moves the front office made for depth is shining through.  The clippers?  let go of montrez harrell, lou williams.  But kept reggie jackson?  drafted Terrance Mann?  Maybe the rondo move didn't work.  but cousins has been working out.  Morris?  Their depth is working wonders in a bunch of games where Kawhi isn't on the floor, and neither is Ibaka.  Compare this to the Lakers, who this year brought in Montrez Harrell, Schroder, Drummond.  All seemed like amazing pick ups, but when their stars were hurt, it didn't seem to work.  The most telling was when there was 6 min left in the play in game with the warriors, and none of their big pickups were on the floor.  It was still Caruso, Kuz, KCP types on the floor.  although i think THT seems to be working out.  But the Hawks sans Trae dominating a game?  have to give some credit to the guys who assembled that team.  Suns winning two WCF games without Chris Paul?  Mavs couldn't win one with injured Luka.  Jazz wimming games without conley.  Denver winning games without murray.  




It's always been important for teams to have good pieces, especially championship teams with great role player pieces.  Insanely important role players like Robery horry, horace grant types.  Modern day 3 and D guys.  Iggy, barnes, mario chalmers? FVV exploding.  I've pondered if Dallas should have kept Seth Curry.   He did so well for philly.  Did they miss him?  More than anything, this year, is exposing the skill set of the front offices.  Championships have been won or lost in moves made years ago.  Draft picks taken years in advance.  But most of the time the stars are sucking up all the energy.  But the truth is,  you need a good front office to win a chip.  someone to make a ballsy gamble, trading demar for kawhi.  picking up cp3 to pair with your harden.  (ok they didn't win a chip but they got hella hella close).  




It's so fascinating watching some of these teams succeed.  It's not like Trae is more talented or amazing than luka.  But one team is farther, and i do think the front office has a big thing to do with this.  Steve Ballmer, bringing in Jerry West, firing Doc, hiring Ty Lue.  contributes to breaking the curse?  For sure right?  then watching Doc tank the sixers.  I think this postseason is really telling when it comes to things like, is Polinka a top tier GM or is it about Lebron and AD.  How are these franchises doing:  Blazers, Celtics, Nuggets.  Vs the Suns and the Hawks.  How good are teams drafting and developing and coaching.  This postseason, more than any, has been showing and exposing some of the talent and skills on the GM/front office positions.","t3_oaq941","https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/oaq941/these_playoffs_are_really_showing_some_other/",113,"t1_h3jni4q","2021-30-06 3:33:16 AM","When I see Atlanta and Phoenix I see a lot of talented young players outplaying their contracts.

"nbadiscussion","chickenripp","Why did CP3 get MVP votes when he's clearly the 3rd best player on his own team?","disclaimer: i don't like chris paul even a little bit

Not much else to add but need to fill the word count. The facts that CP3 made both all NBA and all star over devin booker (only made all star as an injury replacement) baffled me all season. 

Obviously I'm not denying the positive impacts CP3 has had on the suns, but when people start putting him in the MVP convo is where I draw the line. Don't think anybody will argue 16-5-9 regular season stats are MVP numbers. Booker was better than CP3 all season, and now Booker and Ayton are both better than CP3 in the playoffs.

CP3 was injured and played like trash in the first round against LAL and the suns were fine without him. In the current series against the LAC, PHX again won 2 games without him.

When people say ""last year PHX was 10th and this year they're 2nd and in the WCF with him"" I feel is a very misleading statement. It would be like saying last year ATL was 14th and this year theyre 5th and in the ECF, therefore Bogdanovic is the MVP. 

CP3 put PHX over the top sure but definitely doesnt make him the MVP or more deserving of awards than booker IMO.","t3_o96734","https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/o96734/why_did_cp3_get_mvp_votes_when_hes_clearly_the/",0,"t1_h397dvr","2021-27-06 2:49:13 PM","Its just media narrative because the other players on the suns couldn't possibly be good enough to go 51-21. So it must have been CP3 working miracles. The media is full of causals who put out lazy takes all the time. In reality the suns have a really legit roster from top to bottom and CP3 plays a big part in that.

Not much else to add but need to fill the word count. The facts that CP3 made both all NBA and all star over devin booker (only made all star as an injury replacement) baffled me all season. 

Obviously I'm not denying the positive impacts CP3 has had on the suns, but when people start putting him in the MVP convo is where I draw the line. Don't think anybody will argue 16-5-9 regular season stats are MVP numbers. Booker was better than CP3 all season, and now Booker and Ayton are both better than CP3 in the playoffs.
