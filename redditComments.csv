But generally they like guys who show up in shape and play hard.  Avoid long passes down court unless it's wide open.  Move without the ball by cutting to the basket as well as getting open for a jumper.  They also like guys who have played organized ball in the past.  It's just easier to coordinate practices.  Try to get an idea how practices and tryouts went the previous year with the coach.  Winning the wind sprints - or finishing well - helps out a lot.   Also, everyone trying out will be nervous whether they admit it or not.  Don't get too concerned about things that mess up.  Try to put them behind you and remain focused and engaged.  The coach will probably already have a good idea who he is keeping.   Show you can keep up in practice, you can learn drills quickly and you are in shape.  There will probably be a good number of guys who do not show back up day #2.

Most players just starting out, probably around $30-$50k in a second-tier Euro league or so, and a lot more if you’re good enough for the top tier Euro leagues (aka you’re one of the best players on your P5 D1 team). Outside of Europe and China (China is the hardest to break into but the most lucrative), salaries go down. Got a few friends/know a few people that play professionally overseas. One was the star of a low-end D1 team that made the tournament and led the team in nearly every statistical category. One was a starter on a P5 and played in the G League. One was a D3 All-American that broke records. One was a starter on multiple P5 teams.

"Basketball","G2_Parejko","Should I change my shooting hand?","Hey so I've been in a bit of a dilemma recently. I have been playing basketball for 10 years. When I was a kid, I shot two handed especially from mid range and three until I was like 13 or 14, with using my left more than my right when I shot. Eventually at 14, my form became a one motion shot primarily involving my left hand shooting the ball and my right hand being a guide hand. I have developed strong muscle memory since then and it does sort of feel natural to shoot with my left hand up until now, and im 18. But the thing is... I'm right handed in my everyday life. It is my stronger arm. I write with it. I told someone I shoot with my left even though I'm right handed and they told me it was unnecessary. I normally go for right hand floaters and layups because they feel easier--more natural for me. I'm just stuck on whether I should change my shooting hand if it will make it easier to shoot or allow me to shoot from farther later on in my life. Should I change my shooting hand to my right? Or keep it left?","t3_ofsqnb","https://www.reddit.com/r/Basketball/comments/ofsqnb/should_i_change_my_shooting_hand/",3,"t1_h4eksi5","2021-07-07 2:58:52 PM","Ben, get yourself a proper shooting coach instead of asking randoms on reddit",8,0,1,0,0,5
