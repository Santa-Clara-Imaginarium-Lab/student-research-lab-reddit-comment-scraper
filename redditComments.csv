nbadiscussion,seemypinky,Ben Simmons MIGHT have a breakout year next season.,2021-21-06 1:24:33 AM,"Based on all that has transpired these past few years, especially this season and this year's playoffs, we all have enough evidence to rank him accurately and accordingly to what he brings to the table. This year, this postseason, he's exposed entirely. In previous seasons, you could still argue that his upside outweighs his flaws and that he's still young back then, so more room to improve. We also put into consideration the coaching from his previous seasons, we are waiting for the right coach to unlock his full potential. Now. After having an excellent regular season as a team securing the first seed in the east, having a coach that is a lot experienced albeit being flawed, and having all of his teammates trusting him to co-lead them into contention, Ben actually had a great year. Despite seeing his game stagnated from what it was in the previous seasons, his strengths as a player actually stood out this season as he finishes as a runner-up in the DPOY voting, with stats/analytics supporting his bid for the award. But let us take note that this is done by him, being as chill as he is and being the same as ever. This postseason shattered all that momentum he was carrying with him, with teams consistently exploiting his lack of an offensive game, neutralizing his great passing as well. Most importantly, he allowed it to get into his head, and completely took away all his confidence as he's shown in this very crucial game 7 to this team. As a player, his value to his team, and his reputation throughout the league, he is at his all-time low right now. But I won't count him out yet, not until next season. Let us remember that he has the talent, the God-given athletic ability, and he is still in his mid-20s. This is somewhat comparable to the Pistons that MJ needs to overcome, LeBron's Boston obstacle, etc. If this event, happens to spark Simmons passion or whatever it is in him, this might unlock his potential for the upcoming seasons. This is the prime example of what having something to prove looks like, everybody will continue to count him out from this point out. He only has 2 options, succumb and get crushed by it, or to overcome it and become the ATG talent he was projected to be. It's disappointing to see a player of his caliber get destroyed like this, he has so much left in him for him to peak at that level.

I think you’re right. Ben Simmons career has been completely analogous to lebron and MJ’s up to this point. It’s just some hurdles he has to overcome. For Lebron it was Boston. For Jordan it was Detroit. Maybe next year he’ll finally break out and try a jump shot. Or maybe hit two free throws in a row. Or, now I know this asking a lot, maybe, just maybe, he could dunk the ball when the only defender in the paint is a foot shorter than him.

nbadiscussion,ledouxx,Ben Simmons Trade for D'Angelo Russell?,2021-22-06 12:12:41 AM,"The Timberwolves are one of the only teams that could utilize Simmons' strength both on the offensive and defensive side. His DPOY level defense would obviously help their defense (comparing to Russell). Simmons presence around the paint in the half court offense often relegated Embiid to standing around the perimeter, but this is a much lesser problem with Towns on the floor. Playing Simmons next to 4 shooters would give space to drive or utilize his playmaking to find open shooters (he ranked near the top in the league in created 3-point opportunities). 

Philadelphia gets rid of Simmons and replaces him with a near All-Star-level point guard who is still on the younger side and who can consistently create his own shot, something the Sixers have desperately lacked from perimeter players. He is a bad defender but the sixers have a good team defense. A Russell Maxey backcourt might be problematic defensively, so it might depend on the role the Sixers want to give Maxey in the future. 

One problem might be the Russell - Towns friendship, however it's still a business and considering the long playoff drought of the Timberwolves, the Timberwolves might come to the conclusion that the current Towns - Russell pairing is not enough to compete in the playoffs in the West.

The trade would work out straight up but you could add picks in either direction obviously, depending on how you value the players",t3_o5gzkk,https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/o5gzkk/ben_simmons_trade_for_dangelo_russell/,15,15,t1_h2n22z4,2021-22-06 4:24:41 AM,"It would be a highway robbery for Minnesota.

nbadiscussion,ShampooMonK,8 observations from this post-season.,2021-24-06 11:23:22 AM,"1. Big Ball vs Small Ball centers
1. One of things that was interesting was how in 2020, it was a season of small ball centers taking center stage. Bam Adebayo helped sink the Celtics. Anthony Davis was a defensive force. The Rockets bet the farm on PJ Tucker. All these dudes, outside Davis, were legit small for the center, while Davis is skinny. All of them had some level of success.
2. In 2021 though, arguably what we're seeing is the rise of Big ball centers -- guys with some offensive skills but whose role is really to play D and PLAY BIG. Three of the four teams left count on guys who are Big Ball centers -- Ayton, whose a mobile 7 footer and the talk of the playoffs, Lopez, a sweet shooting big man who can box out and defend well, and Clint Capela, whose as close to a poor man's clone of Dwight Howard as any in the league. This is a big difference than from last year. I'm defining the big ball center by what they do on D not O, btw. 2. Superstar/Hybrid Centers have done well this playoffs, but if you ask them to do too much on offense, you didn't get out of the second round
1. The common thread of KD, Embiid and Jokic. KD saw his teammates go down and him step up to play big and score, setting up the offense. He did amazing. It wasn't enough, eliminated. Embiid had to also be the last line of defense, play big and set up his offense. It was too much, eliminated. Jokic saw his teammates go down, play big and set up his offense. MVP of the regular season, but that's too much, eliminated. If you compare this to Giannis, whose job was to play D reasonably well while also leading the offense, but not be the entirety of the defense at the rim and doing defensive rebounding, you see why he's still standing. It's going to be a while before we see a Shaq in 2000 performance ever again, something that should make us appreciate that ALOT more. 3. Rudy Gobert took the heat for Utah losing, but the reality is is that injuries caught up to the team's guards. 1. We all just like to make fun of him and it's okay, he should gain a thicker skin. This one's been done ad nauseam. Just remember -- to lose a 26 point lead, both your defense and offense must fail, and considering Reggie Jackson and Terrance Mann suddenly went super saiyan, from all over the court, while Don Mitchell just couldn't score anymore, I put that lost squarely on the guards of the team, and then on Rudy. Wouldn't be shocked if their injuries are worse than we think.
4. The Suns are a young team but play like an old team, they don't turn the ball over that much and that will likely be a big reason they beat the Clippers, if they beat the Clippers.
1. When I predicted the Lakers to go over the Suns in the first round, I was relying on old logic -- young teams don't win, even in wacky seasons. Well, that's because young teams have a tendency to self combust, turning the ball over under pressure, not knowing who should shoot on the last play, having some chemistry issues, etc. That and the Lakers thrived off teams turning the ball over last season, turning Russell Westbrook's dribbling into a liability, something that led to transition and then AD putting the other team in foul trouble. Well... I was wrong! The Suns have legit none of those issues of young teams and are pretty careful with the basketball! One wonders if this due to CP3 being a basketball wizard and changing his approach with age and playing on that OKC team last season. I genuinely believe this is the net effect of CP3, he's one of those beyond the box score leader types. 5. Injuries had a big effect, but so do role players stepping up.
1. People will write about this 1000x here so I'm not going to add anything. Have at it.
6. Ben Simmons scraped by on potential and now that's simply not good enough.
1. 10 years ago, Ben Simmons would've played like Rajon Rondo, and would have been expected to have similar levels of success to Rondo. This legit wasn't that long ago, Rondo was phenomenal for a while and the league isn't fully in ""everyone must shoot"" mode until the Warriors first chip, though teams were experimenting. We still have players that are relics of that era, though increasingly, they're less effective. 2. As his season is now over, it's time to assess Ben Simmons and the role of ""non shooting, defense first point guards."" One surmises that a point guard who can't shoot, can't effectively do his job despite being 6'10, because the defense sags back in the playoffs. This isn't so much an issue if you're going to be running at the basket all the time in transition. The thing with playoff ball is that, transition opportunities get limited by teams suddenly playing much more carefully with the ball.
3. This then begs the question, are we simply miscasting Ben Simmons as a point guard now? Is he ACTUALLY a point guard or is he... a point forward or small ball 5? I think this is the major question surrounding Simmons, which is A) what is he and B) how much should he be enabled by teams (the Westbrook question). It doesn't take a genius to see he's probably needing a rethinking of what he can do by someone. 7. Trae Young, Kawhi Leonard, Luka Doncic, Kevin Durant, Donovan Mitchell, Devin Booker are keeping Kobe's memory alive even better than the 2020 Lakers did, by shooting from the midrange so effectively. 1. Arguably, this should be the least shocking thing about the playoffs -- when the clock ticks down and the balls in the superstars hands, their job is to make silly, ridiculous shots, like Kobe did, like Wade did, like Jordan did, etc. The midrange is the superstars shot, it's the shot they get paid for, and I just listed 6 guys who having that midrange in the game is probably lifting them past their peers. 8. The Hawks vs Bucks is a major question of winning in the NBA -- is defense or offense more important? 1. The Hawks are a better offensive team that is an okay defensive team. Capela helps. But you know, their best defense is shooting and making shots, kinda like the old Rockets were.
2. The Bucks are a staunch SLOW IT DOWN AND TRY TO SCORE ON US defensive team, with some shooters to keep the game close if the other team is scoring a lot or make the game get out of hand if the opponent can't score at all. They have four good defenders in the starting lineup, and in a way, somewhat resemble the 2020 Lakers, only Middleton is in the AD free safety role.
3. I don't know who would win, my prediction even after game 1 is this is a knockdown dragout series, but there's legit two philosophies on the floor, and if the Bucks win it would match my perception that BAD ASS D wins titles. But they also could not win. I don't know. 9. The teams left standing all have a combination of young guys and veterans, affirming what I, a know nothing fan, have always believed in was the championship formula.
1. Whether its the Hawks with Gallinari, Bucks with Jrue, Clippers with Reggie Jackson, or the Suns with CP3, the impact of guys with 10 plus year careers in the league can often be felt in that even if they're bad, they provide some steadiness in the playoffs. Arguably these guys have bigger roles than they had, getting their big contracts, outside Reggie Jackson.

The Rockets bet the farm on PJ Tucker. Rockets didn't bet the farm on **PJ Tucker,** they had no choice. Rockets made the mistake of trading for Westbrook. Now, they were forced to be committed to the micro-ball route and traded for RoCo and trotted out a small ball lineup that featured PJ Tucker, (who ALSO was DISGRUNTLED already for not being given a contract extension and for playing through a pinched nerve at center while standing a buck 6'5,) at the 5. I never understood why they were convinced that the micro ball of relying on a lot of shooters that didn't well shoot at all was going to work... RoCo had a terrible shooting year at 31.5%, Eric Gordon shot 31.7%. You really need some positive production rather than mass inefficient volume 3 point shooting. Honestly, I think the Rockets made a mistake trading away Capela. I never understood why they were so quick to get rid of him, getting rid of your best rebounder, shot blocker, and under 26 locked up for next 3 years. But Westbrook/Harden killed their spacing and rendered Capela useless. \_\_\_ >Bam Adebayo helped sink the Celtics. Bam Adebayo was *a beast against the Celtics,* but we were also featuring Daniel Theis at 6'8, who's also a small ball center himself. The refs also seemed to love calling fouls on Theis, and we had terrible depth. Honestly, I'm not going to make excuses, but I think we had a better team on paper, but failed to execute. Credit to to Miami for doing their job. &#x200B; >Anthony Davis was a defensive force. Who still shouldn't be playing the 5, although that's his ideal position in the modern NBA. The problem is his inability to stay healthy plus being banged up against the bigger bulkier 5's is not a good plan for his health moving forward. That's why the Lakers have been intent in getting someone like a Drummond or Gasol to spell him at those minutes. >In 2021 though, arguably what we're seeing is the rise of Big ball centers -- guys with some offensive skills but whose role is really to play D and PLAY BIG. Three of the four teams left count on guys who are Big Ball centers -- Ayton, whose a mobile 7 footer and the talk of the playoffs, Lopez, a sweet shooting big man who can box out and defend well, and Clint Capela, whose as close to a poor man's clone of Dwight Howard as any in the league. This is a big difference than from last year. I'm defining the big ball center by what they do on D not O, btw. Yeah, but a lot of these bigs all benefit greatly from a team that has a solid PnR partner in Trae Young/CP3/Booker. I will say Lopez is different, because he has changed his shot profile to help space the floor. &#x200B; >Superstar/Hybrid Centers have done well this playoffs, but if you ask them to do too much on offense, you didn't get out of the second round There's a common trend in these superstar centers not making it out of the second round, and **that can be attributed to missing their 2nd options or lack of one,** (Simmons, Murray, Irving/Harden.) Irving/Harden were in and out, and Harris/Aaron Gordon/Tobias Harris all played below their expectations. Your role players and 2nd stars need to show up to win. There's just too many talented teams that have plenty of depth and pieces to make it a tough series.

Wouldn't be shocked if their injuries are worse than we think. Gobert can't solve the Jazz's weak perimeter defenders constantly giving up corner 3's, he defended pretty well. Terance Man just went ham, tip your hat off to him. When Gobert's forced to switch out and you're taking away and negating his shot blocking abilities, but you cannot also be happy with how passive at times, Gobert was whenever there was a smaller defender on him. Gobert is getting paid $40 million, he needs to learn maybe some basic post moves. Ayton, being switched on Morris would've been a field day for him. &#x200B; >The Suns are a young team but play like an old team, they don't turn the ball over that much and that will likely be a big reason they beat the Clippers, if they beat the Clippers. > >When I predicted the Lakers to go over the Suns in the first round, I was relying on old logic -- young teams don't win, even in wacky seasons.

I genuinely believe this is the net effect of CP3, he's one of those beyond the box score leader types. Young or old, it doesn't matter. They have the talent + experience. I think it's also a given at this point that players like Jae Crowder or CP3 help change the culture of the team. They are great leaders or role players that you can fit on any team. It's no coincidence that Crowder or Trevor Ariza's been such a journeymen. Plenty of teams value dogs.",3,0.098,0.765,0.137,0.9941,3.37
nbadiscussion,Camctrail,8 observations from this post-season.,2021-24-06 11:23:22 AM,"1. Big Ball vs Small Ball centers
1. One of things that was interesting was how in 2020, it was a season of small ball centers taking center stage. Bam Adebayo helped sink the Celtics. Anthony Davis was a defensive force. The Rockets bet the farm on PJ Tucker. All these dudes, outside Davis, were legit small for the center, while Davis is skinny. All of them had some level of success.
2. In 2021 though, arguably what we're seeing is the rise of Big ball centers -- guys with some offensive skills but whose role is really to play D and PLAY BIG. Three of the four teams left count on guys who are Big Ball centers -- Ayton, whose a mobile 7 footer and the talk of the playoffs, Lopez, a sweet shooting big man who can box out and defend well, and Clint Capela, whose as close to a poor man's clone of Dwight Howard as any in the league. This is a big difference than from last year. I'm defining the big ball center by what they do on D not O, btw. 2. Superstar/Hybrid Centers have done well this playoffs, but if you ask them to do too much on offense, you didn't get out of the second round
1. The common thread of KD, Embiid and Jokic. KD saw his teammates go down and him step up to play big and score, setting up the offense. He did amazing. It wasn't enough, eliminated. Embiid had to also be the last line of defense, play big and set up his offense. It was too much, eliminated. Jokic saw his teammates go down, play big and set up his offense. MVP of the regular season, but that's too much, eliminated. If you compare this to Giannis, whose job was to play D reasonably well while also leading the offense, but not be the entirety of the defense at the rim and doing defensive rebounding, you see why he's still standing. It's going to be a while before we see a Shaq in 2000 performance ever again, something that should make us appreciate that ALOT more. 3. Rudy Gobert took the heat for Utah losing, but the reality is is that injuries caught up to the team's guards. 1. We all just like to make fun of him and it's okay, he should gain a thicker skin. This one's been done ad nauseam. Just remember -- to lose a 26 point lead, both your defense and offense must fail, and considering Reggie Jackson and Terrance Mann suddenly went super saiyan, from all over the court, while Don Mitchell just couldn't score anymore, I put that lost squarely on the guards of the team, and then on Rudy. Wouldn't be shocked if their injuries are worse than we think.
4. The Suns are a young team but play like an old team, they don't turn the ball over that much and that will likely be a big reason they beat the Clippers, if they beat the Clippers.
1. When I predicted the Lakers to go over the Suns in the first round, I was relying on old logic -- young teams don't win, even in wacky seasons. Well, that's because young teams have a tendency to self combust, turning the ball over under pressure, not knowing who should shoot on the last play, having some chemistry issues, etc. That and the Lakers thrived off teams turning the ball over last season, turning Russell Westbrook's dribbling into a liability, something that led to transition and then AD putting the other team in foul trouble. Well... I was wrong! The Suns have legit none of those issues of young teams and are pretty careful with the basketball! One wonders if this due to CP3 being a basketball wizard and changing his approach with age and playing on that OKC team last season. I genuinely believe this is the net effect of CP3, he's one of those beyond the box score leader types. 5. Injuries had a big effect, but so do role players stepping up.
1. People will write about this 1000x here so I'm not going to add anything. Have at it.
6. Ben Simmons scraped by on potential and now that's simply not good enough.
1. 10 years ago, Ben Simmons would've played like Rajon Rondo, and would have been expected to have similar levels of success to Rondo. This legit wasn't that long ago, Rondo was phenomenal for a while and the league isn't fully in ""everyone must shoot"" mode until the Warriors first chip, though teams were experimenting. We still have players that are relics of that era, though increasingly, they're less effective. 2. As his season is now over, it's time to assess Ben Simmons and the role of ""non shooting, defense first point guards."" One surmises that a point guard who can't shoot, can't effectively do his job despite being 6'10, because the defense sags back in the playoffs. This isn't so much an issue if you're going to be running at the basket all the time in transition. The thing with playoff ball is that, transition opportunities get limited by teams suddenly playing much more carefully with the ball.
3. This then begs the question, are we simply miscasting Ben Simmons as a point guard now? Is he ACTUALLY a point guard or is he... a point forward or small ball 5? I think this is the major question surrounding Simmons, which is A) what is he and B) how much should he be enabled by teams (the Westbrook question). It doesn't take a genius to see he's probably needing a rethinking of what he can do by someone. 7. Trae Young, Kawhi Leonard, Luka Doncic, Kevin Durant, Donovan Mitchell, Devin Booker are keeping Kobe's memory alive even better than the 2020 Lakers did, by shooting from the midrange so effectively. 1. Arguably, this should be the least shocking thing about the playoffs -- when the clock ticks down and the balls in the superstars hands, their job is to make silly, ridiculous shots, like Kobe did, like Wade did, like Jordan did, etc. The midrange is the superstars shot, it's the shot they get paid for, and I just listed 6 guys who having that midrange in the game is probably lifting them past their peers. 8. The Hawks vs Bucks is a major question of winning in the NBA -- is defense or offense more important? 1. The Hawks are a better offensive team that is an okay defensive team. Capela helps. But you know, their best defense is shooting and making shots, kinda like the old Rockets were.
2. The Bucks are a staunch SLOW IT DOWN AND TRY TO SCORE ON US defensive team, with some shooters to keep the game close if the other team is scoring a lot or make the game get out of hand if the opponent can't score at all. They have four good defenders in the starting lineup, and in a way, somewhat resemble the 2020 Lakers, only Middleton is in the AD free safety role.
3. I don't know who would win, my prediction even after game 1 is this is a knockdown dragout series, but there's legit two philosophies on the floor, and if the Bucks win it would match my perception that BAD ASS D wins titles. But they also could not win. I don't know. 9. The teams left standing all have a combination of young guys and veterans, affirming what I, a know nothing fan, have always believed in was the championship formula.
1. Whether its the Hawks with Gallinari, Bucks with Jrue, Clippers with Reggie Jackson, or the Suns with CP3, the impact of guys with 10 plus year careers in the league can often be felt in that even if they're bad, they provide some steadiness in the playoffs.

For instance, there is a huge group of people that defend players like Westbrook, Giannis and Gobert despite the fact that they have come up short of expectations in the playoffs. Coaches such as Dwane Casey and Budenholzer were both very successful regular season coaches that came up short of expectations in the playoffs and have received almost unanimous disapproval because of their post season struggles. We can't forget that Bud was the coach of the year in 2015 and 2019 both years when he took different teams from mediocre eastern conference teams to 1st seeds. 

Just to be clear, I put A LOT of value in the playoffs. I love play off basketball, and the teams I route for I don't want to just have a great regular season followed by a 1st round exit. 

Does this have to do with the way fans relate to players vs. the way they relate to coaches?

If you get off to a horrific start, that’s enough to make a player or coach change. But if you roll along fine, have to deal with injuries, or stay at least competitive, it’s harder to judge off regular season. Playoffs are a much more accurate gauge. That’s the moment you get to see coaches under pressure. How do they make adjustments? How do they handle adversity? Can they get the most out of their best players in the big moments when it matters? Playoff results are much more telling for what a coach actually is. For example, guys like Mike Budenholzer and Doc Rivers have strange rotations that usually get picked apart. Coaches like Ty Lue are shown to be full of adjustments and making minutes count. Coaches like Spo and Pop find a way to get the most out of their players and run good systems when it matters. So unless the regular season is filled with locker room issues or bad starts, it’s much harder to gauge off of that compared to playoffs.",7,0.081,0.807,0.112,0.4098,6.12

nbadiscussion,Hurricanemasta,The obvious Ben Simmons trade,2021-24-06 2:27:48 PM,"With the recent [reports](https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2944958-report-nets-brass-was-upset-with-kyrie-irving-gm-would-listen-to-trade-offers) of the Nets front office possibly being open to discussing trading Kyrie Irving this offseason, I think the obvious deal is Ben Simmons for Kyrie - straight up. The salaries basically match up (Simmons actually makes a few million less than Kyrie), which is probably the major roadblock for most trade ideas for Ben Simmons. Moreover, this swap would give each team exactly what they want/need.
Nets: They address their greatest weakness - defense, with an All-Defensive first teamer. I am personally of the opinion that Ben Simmons should switch to center, or at least the frontcourt, where his defense will continue to have massive impact and his shooting woes will be minimized. Playing with two of the most talented scorers of the generation, if not ever, Simmons can stand in the dunker's spot all day and not ruin the offensive structure as Kevin Durant and James Harden do their damage from the midrange and long range, and he's there as a vertical spacer. Plus, maybe he can pick up some tips from Durant and Harden and evolve back into a useful offensive player with a more reliable free throw. All of this fails to mention that when Harden goes out, you replace him with an All-NBA player at point guard, and Ben Simmons durability shames Kyrie's.
Sixers: Shooting and iso offense - exactly what they need. With Kyrie's excellent marksmanship, Embiid can permanently park himself inside and finally eschew shooting 3's, something he's verbally stated he dislikes. When Embiid goes out, the Sixers will still be able to put points on the board with one of the league's best iso players and scorers. Is Kyrie a defensive downgrade? Sure, but the Sixers still have an All-Defense player in Matisse Thybulle - just give him a few more minutes (25-ish?) to paper over the deficit. Plus the offensive upgrade from Simmons to Kyrie should make it a net positive even with more time on the court for a weak offensive player like Thybulle.
And best of all, we the fans get two more complete championship contenders that boost the East further on to the level of the Western contenders. Everybody wins!",t3_o7aely,https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/o7aely/the_obvious_ben_simmons_trade/,4,22,t1_h2zunko,2021-25-06 6:55:49 AM,"I've been watching the NBA long enough to know that its history is littered with ""coulda woulda shoulda"", so for me, the idea that the Nets are so good when healthy that they should fairly easily cruise to a title next year if healthy simply doesn't hold water. Could the Sonics have won in '96 if they'd put Payton on Jordan earlier in the series? Would the Lakers have beaten the Pistons in '89 if Magic hadn't gotten injured? Should the '11 Heatles - with three Hall of Famers - have handled the Mavs with ease? Do I believe this trade is realistic? Of course not. Most of the trades discussed on reddit are not. Philly is going to struggle mightily finding any trading partner for Ben Simmons, and Kyrie has enough connections with the Nets to supersede any inclination Sean Marks may have to ""listen to offers"". My basic assertions are these - Kyrie fits wonderfully on the Sixers, Ben Simmons fits wonderfully on the Nets, both teams get demonstrably better, and the salaries match. If the GMs of these two teams were HurricaneMarks and DarrylMasta, I would pull the trigger on this so fast your head would spin. Personally, I believe that running it back is only a real strategy for a young team who lacks cohesion, and even then it's a strategy to get better, not win a title. NBA teams need to push the envelope every year just to keep up, and you don't have to look very far in the past to see instances where it paid off. Could the Raptors have simply run it back in '19 with their 59-win team? Would the Warriors have been just as well off keeping Harrison Barnes after a season in which they won 73? Should the '18 Nets continue to develop their young core in the hopes of climbing the Eastern ranks? After the 2012 finals, everyone thought the Thunder would be the next dynasty, and they they were destined for at least a handful of titles, but things happen. They ran it back again and again without making moves to become demonstrably better and they never sniffed the finals again. For my imagination, this is an interesting and plausible deal, and I'd tune in to the Sixers and Nets much more frequently than I do now because they'd both be more complete teams without redundant or deeply flawed for their system's players.

nbadiscussion,YelIowmamba,How do you use the postseason vs. the regular season to evaluate players or coaches?,2021-24-06 9:00:52 AM,"I've noticed a reasonable discrepancy in the way fans/commentators value players vs. the way they value coaches. For instance, there is a huge group of people that defend players like Westbrook, Giannis and Gobert despite the fact that they have come up short of expectations in the playoffs. Coaches such as Dwane Casey and Budenholzer were both very successful regular season coaches that came up short of expectations in the playoffs and have received almost unanimous disapproval because of their post season struggles. We can't forget that Bud was the coach of the year in 2015 and 2019 both years when he took different teams from mediocre eastern conference teams to 1st seeds. 

Just to be clear, I put A LOT of value in the playoffs. I love play off basketball, and the teams I route for I don't want to just have a great regular season followed by a 1st round exit. 

Does this have to do with the way fans relate to players vs. the way they relate to coaches?

They are both known for their playmaking and general offensive prowess (over their athleticism and defensive chops). They are both touted as the face of their respective franchises, now and in the upcoming seasons. You get the picture.

Difference is, one is on a team that is in the remaining four franchises still vying for a championship this season, while the other is in offseason mode. I'd just like to get your opinions on their situations. Could it be due to the players themselves? Is it the lack of a true co-star for Luka (KP vs Collins)? Is it the construction for the rest of the team? Is it coaching? Is it the FO or the rest of the organization? Or could it be something more external, like the odd predicament the league is in right now (injury-riddled, to say the least) or that the East is weaker than the West (or some combination of match-ups they had along the way)?

**Recent superstar trades:-**
***Harden (3 years left on his contract)-***
Caris LeVert, Kurucs, three first round draft picks (2022, 2024 and 2026) and four first round pick swaps (2021, 2023, 2025 and 2027) to Houston ***AD (1 year left on his contract)-***
Ingram, Lonzo, Hart, two first round picks (2019, 2022, 2024 or 2025) + pick swap (2023)
***Jrue Holiday (based on the trade package, 1 year left on his contract)***
Bledsoe, George Hill, three future first-round picks, and two additional Draft pick swaps. **Potential destinations:-** Sixers (Simmons, Maxey + Picks) Knicks (Picks) Nuggets (MPJ, Murray + Picks) Boston (Brown + Picks) Realistically, Dame can't contend in Portland and if he does actually want out as rumoured I think it's likely one of the four team that I've picked above and would involve a minimum of four 1st round picks. I don't think going to New York or Boston will make them an immediate title contender but Knicks will have the cap space and ability to sign another star. What's a good trade package?

nbadiscussion,DeModsCanSookMe,Kawhi to the Hawks in FA?,2021-27-06 4:14:10 PM,"If Kawhi decides to test the market in Free Agency this summer, I think the Hawks should definitely be on his radar. Here are some reasons why.
1. The Hawks don’t have to give up too much to get him. As it stands now, in order to clear enough cap space to give him the max (~$39.35 mil.), the Hawks would only have to renounce all their cap holds (including John Collins’), and dump the salaries of Gallo, Kris Dunn, and Bruno Fernando; sending those contracts and a 2nd-rounder or two to OKC probably does the job. That isn’t nothing — Gallo and John Collins are good players — but that doesn’t compare to Kawhi’s value, and the Hawks get to keep their young wings (Reddish, Huerter, and Hunter) and their 1st for this year.
2. The Hawks have the pieces to build a contender right now. As is, the Hawks’ core of Young, Hunter, Bogdanovic, Huerter, Capela, and Reddish are already pretty good, and have proven that the playoffs aren’t too big for them. Adding Leonard makes the Hawks true title contenders, and that’s before them rounding out their roster with vet Free Agents using their MLE and BAE. The Hawks could realistically field a lineup of
PG: Young
SG: Bogdanovic
SF: Hunter
PF: Leonard
C: Capela with a second unit of PG: Ish Smith
SG: Huerter
SF: Reddish
PF: Bobby Portis
C: Okongwu / Vet Min. Big
That team is deep, versatile, and well-rounded: a good mix for playoff basketball. Note also that Nate McMillan seems perfectly capable as a coach and should be the Hawks HC long-term, which is a plus.
3. The Hawks have the flexibility to trade for a disgruntled star next year, and that could truly make them special. Unlike most other teams contending for titles, the Hawks have good young players on cheap contracts for next year, and have all of their draft picks. If a star like Bradley Beal or Zach Lavine demands a trade, the Atlanta Hawks can outbid other teams in order to acquire them via trade. They could really sweeten the pot with multiple young players, numerous first round picks, and an established vet while still being a title contender worthy of a star player’s respect and time. That’s something that the Clippers and many other contenders can’t do, which makes them significantly less capable of improving their rosters substantially. This is what makes the Hawks uniquely good as a free agent landing spot. Adding a third star to Trae Young and Kawhi Leonard in 2022 would be entirely possible and would make the Hawks a true force in the NBA for years to come.
Ultimately, I don’t think this will happen at all, but the Hawks have a lot to offer for Kawhi and would be a good destination for him. What do y’all think?

As it stands now, in order to clear enough cap space to give him the max (~$39.35 mil.), the Hawks would only have to renounce all their cap holds (including John Collins’), and dump the salaries of Gallo, Kris Dunn, and Bruno Fernando; sending those contracts and a 2nd-rounder or two to OKC probably does the job. That isn’t nothing — Gallo and John Collins are good players — but that doesn’t compare to Kawhi’s value, and the Hawks get to keep their young wings (Reddish, Huerter, and Hunter) and their 1st for this year.
2. The Hawks have the pieces to build a contender right now. As is, the Hawks’ core of Young, Hunter, Bogdanovic, Huerter, Capela, and Reddish are already pretty good, and have proven that the playoffs aren’t too big for them. Adding Leonard makes the Hawks true title contenders, and that’s before them rounding out their roster with vet Free Agents using their MLE and BAE. The Hawks could realistically field a lineup of
PG: Young
SG: Bogdanovic
SF: Hunter
PF: Leonard
C: Capela with a second unit of PG: Ish Smith
SG: Huerter
SF: Reddish
PF: Bobby Portis
C: Okongwu / Vet Min. Big
That team is deep, versatile, and well-rounded: a good mix for playoff basketball. Note also that Nate McMillan seems perfectly capable as a coach and should be the Hawks HC long-term, which is a plus.
3. The Hawks have the flexibility to trade for a disgruntled star next year, and that could truly make them special. Unlike most other teams contending for titles, the Hawks have good young players on cheap contracts for next year, and have all of their draft picks. If a star like Bradley Beal or Zach Lavine demands a trade, the Atlanta Hawks can outbid other teams in order to acquire them via trade. They could really sweeten the pot with multiple young players, numerous first round picks, and an established vet while still being a title contender worthy of a star player’s respect and time. That’s something that the Clippers and many other contenders can’t do, which makes them significantly less capable of improving their rosters substantially. This is what makes the Hawks uniquely good as a free agent landing spot. Adding a third star to Trae Young and Kawhi Leonard in 2022 would be entirely possible and would make the Hawks a true force in the NBA for years to come.
Ultimately, I don’t think this will happen at all, but the Hawks have a lot to offer for Kawhi and would be a good destination for him. What do y’all think?

nbadiscussion,addictivesign,What is the future of the Clippers?,2021-27-06 11:05:25 PM,"They’re currently down 3-1 in the WCF to the Suns in a series where they’re more than likely to lose. They have an aging and injury prone Kawhi Leonard who has mysterious handlings of his injuries and doesn’t seem like much of a team leader. They have Paul George who has been better at times this postseason, but has also still come up short at times where the moment needs him to come through. It seems like another wasted year in the Paul George-Kawhi Leonard era. 

A few things going for them: Terance Mann is developing into a fine-caliber role player. Reggie Jackson is playing some of his best basketball ever. Tyronn Lue is proving to be an upgrade at head coach over Doc Rivers. They seem to be a more resilient team than we’re used to. 

But they’re a team capped out and low on realistic flexibility going forward. Kawhi and Ibaka have POs. Jackson and Batum are UFAs this offseason. Most of their best draft capital was given to OKC in the PG trade. Teams such as the Lakers, Warriors, and Nuggets should be healthier in the West next season and will make the Clips path harder. 

I just don’t know what this team looks like in the future. They’re coming up short in their present iteration, and have aging superstars along with tough competition, but also have made some positive steps this season. What should they do going forward? How much longer do you keep the Kawhi-PG duo together?

I know refs don’t always call all violations-traveling and 3 second rules come to mind. But watching refs hold the ball, ready to go, until Giannis finishes his pantomime free throw practice, and then almost never calling a violation when his shots go over 10 seconds is astonishing to me. I don’t watch every game, so maybe they have cut others this same slack, but I haven’t seen anything like it in any game I’ve watched this year. In that sense, the failure of the refs to follow the rule is uniquely benefiting a single team, and is therefore not the same as the laxity in the rules listed above, where they don’t strictly apply the rule even as most teams show violations. That’s a random following of the rule; this allowance for Giannis is a specific act that is repeated multiple times a game. It also seems like the ref standing and waiting for Giannis to be ready, while everyone else on the court is ready and waiting, constitutes a delay of game. A player or coach would certainly get dinged for that kind of delay, wouldn’t they? Even a recent nba last 2 minute report listed two 10 sec violations as Incorrect NonCalls. How are the referees allowed to continue exhibiting such bias in favor of only one team in their refusal to follow this rule for this single player? I’ve seen arguments that they won’t change now because they set precedent throughout the season-that would work if this happened across the board to most teams, but it doesn’t. It is a delay of game, committed willfully and repeatedly by refs, to the benefit of a single player and a single team. What is the rationale for refs causing a delay of game and exhibiting clear bias with their refusal to enforce this rule?",1,0.099,0.798,0.103,-0.2127,2.53
nbadiscussion,TheSmilingDentist,Shouldn't the Sixers trade Embiid instead of Simmons?,2021-28-06 10:30:43 AM,"Okay, 

Controversial take: Joel Embiid is spectacular, a two way phenom, the reason the Sixers are good recently, and simply a player with an MVP type of ceiling. 

But with his injury history, are we sure the Sixers are making the right decision keeping him above Simmons?

Now no one could predict injuries, Embiid is still young, and a center of his caliber is literally impossible to find... 

But isn't that the point? Embiid would fetch a crazy high amount of picks and players if he was traded today, similar to the AD and Jrue Holiday and Paul George trades. Meanwhile, I imagine, Simmons wouldn't. 

So if you did trade Embiid -- who would you get back? Could you trade him for all of New York's assets and picks? or to Oklahoma for a good amount of their draft war chest? Would a team of Ben Simmons + high pick X + new young guy you traded for + Tyrese Maxey, who you assume wouldn't get traded + Tobias Harris eventually be better than what you could build around Embiid? Is Embiid so good that he's worth more risk? 

Meanwhile -- what do you get for Simmons exactly? Are you sure you're getting back a guy who helps you win now? Is that guy the short term answer for a finals appearance? And what if Simmons just improves immediately with a new team and coach?

So I'm just saying, maybe the Sixers should sell high on Embiid and do the quick retool around Simmons instead.",t3_o9p4iw,https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/o9p4iw/shouldnt_the_sixers_trade_embiid_instead_of/,0,9,t1_h3cdx7x,2021-28-06 10:41:51 AM,"> eanwhile -- what do you get for Simmons exactly?

nbadiscussion,Persianx6,How might Shaq's career after 2005 have been different if he had stayed fit and played more?,2021-28-06 2:06:56 AM,"**Shaq's career stats (that I will be using for the purposes of this post):**

From the 1993 to 2005 Season, Shaq averaged 67 games per Season. **For the first scenario I will do the following:**

1. In the final six Seasons of his career, I’m going to continue to use 67 games each year.
2. Instead of using his points per game as they were, I’m instead going to take a different approach, and decrease his ppg by 1.5ppg each successive Season.

**Scenario One:**

&#x200B;

**Now I’m going to assume Shaq:**

1. Ends up playing 20 Seasons instead of 19.
2. Plays 70 games per Season for his remaining seven Seasons (after 2005).
3. Decreased his ppg by 1ppg each year instead of 1.5.

Controversial take: Joel Embiid is spectacular, a two way phenom, the reason the Sixers are good recently, and simply a player with an MVP type of ceiling. 

But with his injury history, are we sure the Sixers are making the right decision keeping him above Simmons?

Now no one could predict injuries, Embiid is still young, and a center of his caliber is literally impossible to find... 

But isn't that the point? Embiid would fetch a crazy high amount of picks and players if he was traded today, similar to the AD and Jrue Holiday and Paul George trades. Meanwhile, I imagine, Simmons wouldn't. 

So if you did trade Embiid -- who would you get back? Could you trade him for all of New York's assets and picks? or to Oklahoma for a good amount of their draft war chest? Would a team of Ben Simmons + high pick X + new young guy you traded for + Tyrese Maxey, who you assume wouldn't get traded + Tobias Harris eventually be better than what you could build around Embiid? Is Embiid so good that he's worth more risk? 

Meanwhile -- what do you get for Simmons exactly? Are you sure you're getting back a guy who helps you win now? Is that guy the short term answer for a finals appearance? And what if Simmons just improves immediately with a new team and coach?

I think the energy they bring to the table without putting up skull crushing eye popping box score stats has been really fun to watch.

I have also really enjoyed seeing some inexperienced young dudes go out there and hoop their asses off in the playoffs- Trae Young, John Collins and D Book come to mind.

I think overall though I personally have most enjoyed watching Paul George play this postseason. I love his impact on the court and watching his sort of “redemption” playoff run has added an emotional component I very much appreciate. Their have been some other big performances by other role players and George sometimes shoots like shit but his composure and ability to smooth the game out is why this Clippers team was able to come back against the Mavs, Jazz and maybe the Suns. Every game has been pretty close, within reach.

This has been a really diverse postseason and I am very interested to hear who you have enjoyed watching play the most.",t3_o9nsuy,https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/o9nsuy/who_has_been_your_favorite_player_to_watch_this/,6,11,t1_h3c7fjx,2021-28-06 9:54:37 AM,"Lord Dario.

Ayton has proved that he can dominate the paint against ACTUAL centers and he has shown flashes this series too (4/5 in the 1Q with 11 points in Game 3).

I noticed a few possessions though where Ayton just didn’t seem that interested in getting the ball. He drifts into the paint, behind his defender, and sort of half throws his hands up whilst thinking about the potential rebound. It would be really great to see him sealing his man, screaming for the ball and showing some intent to score down low. I think this was also exacerbated by Paul and Booker both hunting iso jumpers this game without involving the rest of the team. I also thought Paul was unusually indecisive in the first half and didn’t do enough to get the team in rhythm. By the time Ayton started getting a couple more touches in the 4th, it struck me he was out of sorts and not in the flow of the game. Getting Ayton involved and engaged early should be a priority next game.",18,0.074,0.844,0.082,0.34,2.32

nbadiscussion,philabuster34,The playoffs this year is a testament to James Harden’s legacy.,2021-24-06 6:15:22 AM,"First off, I am a huge James fan and if anyone wants to slander him and come down to Houston and throw fists please let me know.

Secondly my analysis comes from everything James wanted in Houston vs what he could have had.

1. Chris Paul. CP3 and Harden were a great tandem till their personal relationship broke down. James wanted him out and Morey pulled the trigger and sent him to OKC. Now CP3 is leading the young suns into the WCF.

2. Clint Capela. This guy was an elite rebounder for James and he opened up his offense. If James missed a shot Clint was there to keep the offense going. Clint had to be moved since him and Russ clogged the court for James. Now Clint is helping the Hawks in the ECF with another free shooter in Ice Trae.

3. PJ Tucker. James always didn’t like how he didn’t have superstar talent next to him but PJ is a horse. One of the hardest working players in the league and a 3 point shooter. Now he’s in the ECF with the Bucks.

4. Mike D’Antoni. James loved MDA since he turned him from a good scorer to an elite one. MDA coddled him and the team into believing they could sacrifice easy 2 for 3 point shots. Harden followed him to Brooklyn and now they are watching from home. 

5. Daryl Morey. Another guy who coddled James. DM was never afraid to make a risky move that helped James win a title. When he left James wanted out. Now DM is stuck with Ben Simmons trying to prove he can win with Morey ball.

6. Brooklyn Nets. James finally gets his super team but he joins an often injured KD and Kyrie. It ends up not working this season due to his and Kyries injury.

7. Rafael Stone. James didn’t want to give Stone a chance in building a team around him. Stone could have offloaded Russ to the Knicks for expiring contracts to start the rebuild but he went for John Wall to give Harden a chance to consider staying here. Stone got ridiculed for not trading James for Ben Simmons but now it looks like it worked out for the Rockets as they aren’t stuck with Ben and we have the #2 pick.

8. Stephen Silas. This is a coach who James wouldn’t give a chance to. Didn’t show up to training camp. Turns out the players love him and even ex players like Luka Doncic are a starting to realize how important he was.

9. Christian Wood. A player that James really needed. A pick and pop big that he could have used in the playoffs that he didn’t want to give a chance to.

I’m not saying if James stayed we win a title this year. I’m just saying all the reasons he wanted out are starting to hurt his legacy.",t3_o70n95,https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/o70n95/the_playoffs_this_year_is_a_testament_to_james/,2,1,t1_h3i922y,2021-29-06 5:51:28 PM,What a run though!

nbadiscussion,skiddster3,Why aren’t the Suns feeding Ayton?,2021-28-06 9:46:35 PM,I really do not understand why the Suns play the Clippers small ball game when there is literally not a center on the floor for the Clippers. Ayton has proved that he can dominate the paint against ACTUAL centers and he has shown flashes this series too (4/5 in the 1Q with 11 points in Game 3). Not a Suns fan so not sure if there is an underlying rotation issue that is going on or what but it’s infuriating seeing Ayton just stand there towering over Batum doing nothing.,t3_oa18pw,https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/oa18pw/why_arent_the_suns_feeding_ayton/,623,109,t1_h3fnnbz,2021-29-06 5:59:51 AM,"This is kind of like asking why isn't MJ shooting 3s? That just isn't how the Suns/Ayton plays basketball. The Sun's strength, the way they play the game, and the reason why they're so good, comes from their elite passing. They abuse poor defensive positioning and this is how they managed to dominate the regular season. This is also why they shoot so many mid range jumpers as teams will generally guard the key/3pt rather than mid. The reason why Ayton wasn't getting the ball as much was due to the nature of having a smaller man on you. Sure Batum/PG can't bully Ayton, but being smaller, they can reposition/follow a lot quicker giving Booker/CP a smaller window to pass to Ayton. So why don't they just feed Ayton? Because it goes against everything the Suns have built, their entire bball philosophy. Exploit defensive positioning/prioritizing only good high value shots. Going back-to-basket, bully basketball is known for being inefficient. Not only that, but Ayton just is 'not that guy'. And even if he did go iso, I don't see how Ty Lue wouldn't just put Cousins in to negate that action.",14,0.078,0.801,0.121,0.7246,2.71

nbadiscussion,[deleted],These playoffs are really showing some other strengths besides player talent,2021-29-06 10:13:34 PM,"Let me preface this by saying that it does suck that all these stars are/have gone down and not played playoff games.
philosophically I've always felt that the 7 game series format for so many rounds, is built to make sure the best teams win. I think it breaks down in to 3 main parts of a team that are shown in the playoffs. 1) the skill level, clutchness, talent of your major stars. I think this is what most of the viewers are watching for most years. guys who can make shots towards the end of games, guys who can dominate, score, rebound, make highlights, get everyone pumped. Guys like Dame, Luca, etc dominate in these fields. But you can't do it alone in this space. just look at some of the most talented teams in history not winning a chip. For me, the greatest examples are teams like the Lakers with malone and payton. The first year heatles. which brings us to:
2) coaching. which is so much easier to see when it's deficient than when it is working super well. Coaching makes your team work together. Coaching is shown in how well your team is prepped, how you manage the game, call time outs, make adjustments during a game and between games. How you motivate your players. When it's deficient, you get things like Doc Rivers losing 3-1 series leads for not making adjustments. But you need something beyond just super talented players, and great coaching. You need:
3) a really good talented strong front office (and maybe owner with money or who understands their role). I think this year more than any, the front office work is really showing. With stars going down left and right, a lot of moves the front office made for depth is shining through. The clippers? let go of montrez harrell, lou williams. But kept reggie jackson? drafted Terrance Mann? Maybe the rondo move didn't work. but cousins has been working out. Morris? Their depth is working wonders in a bunch of games where Kawhi isn't on the floor, and neither is Ibaka. Compare this to the Lakers, who this year brought in Montrez Harrell, Schroder, Drummond. All seemed like amazing pick ups, but when their stars were hurt, it didn't seem to work. The most telling was when there was 6 min left in the play in game with the warriors, and none of their big pickups were on the floor. It was still Caruso, Kuz, KCP types on the floor. although i think THT seems to be working out. But the Hawks sans Trae dominating a game? have to give some credit to the guys who assembled that team. Suns winning two WCF games without Chris Paul? Mavs couldn't win one with injured Luka. Jazz wimming games without conley. Denver winning games without murray. It's always been important for teams to have good pieces, especially championship teams with great role player pieces. Insanely important role players like Robery horry, horace grant types. Modern day 3 and D guys. Iggy, barnes, mario chalmers? FVV exploding. I've pondered if Dallas should have kept Seth Curry. He did so well for philly. Did they miss him? More than anything, this year, is exposing the skill set of the front offices. Championships have been won or lost in moves made years ago. Draft picks taken years in advance. But most of the time the stars are sucking up all the energy. But the truth is, you need a good front office to win a chip. someone to make a ballsy gamble, trading demar for kawhi. picking up cp3 to pair with your harden. (ok they didn't win a chip but they got hella hella close). It's so fascinating watching some of these teams succeed. It's not like Trae is more talented or amazing than luka. But one team is farther, and i do think the front office has a big thing to do with this. Steve Ballmer, bringing in Jerry West, firing Doc, hiring Ty Lue. contributes to breaking the curse? For sure right? then watching Doc tank the sixers. I think this postseason is really telling when it comes to things like, is Polinka a top tier GM or is it about Lebron and AD. How are these franchises doing: Blazers, Celtics, Nuggets. Vs the Suns and the Hawks. How good are teams drafting and developing and coaching. This postseason, more than any, has been showing and exposing some of the talent and skills on the GM/front office positions.",t3_oaq941,https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/oaq941/these_playoffs_are_really_showing_some_other/,118,31,t1_h3kss6e,2021-30-06 9:34:46 AM,[deleted],2,0,1,0,0,1.5

Miami wanted to sign Jimmy butler, but needed to find a buyer for Hassan Whiteside’s contract. In exchange for helping the transaction go through(and lowering the trade value of the Miami pick), the clippers got moe harkless and an additional future Miami first in 2023. The clipppers than traded the Miami picks, a lot of their own draft capital, and SGA in exchange for Paul George.

(Copied from a previous post) 2020’s Dame Lilard. What he’s done in Portland is amazing. He does more with less help than anyone. He singlehandedly drags them into the playoffs and beats better teams with shots like this. https://youtu.be/a-M3x-eZpV8 2010’s Derrick Rose. Youngest MVP of all time. An unseen combination of quickness, speed and strength. His ability to finish around the rim was amazing. https://youtu.be/ikc-uM_Ekkc 2000’s Ray Allen. Arguably one of the greatest three point shooters of all time, if not the greatest. Led the Celtics to a title. Also turned in a criminally underrated performance as Jesus Shuttlesworth in “He Got Game.” And for those who thought he was just a shooter, here’s footage of him dunking on one of the greatest shot blockers of all time. https://youtu.be/Tdy7yO_tGCA 1990’s Chris Webber. The power forward who was way ahead of his time. He could shoot from outside, handle, and finish. He had an incredibly high basketball IQ and could pick apart defenses with his mind before they even knew what they were doing as evidenced below. https://youtu.be/o7ChxCkVSis 1980’s Julius Erving. You know he’s the best when he gets name checked in a Run DMC song. He was the games greatest dunker and the star that brought the NBA back from the brink. Why was he such a great star? The dimensions of the court didn’t apply to him, neither did gravity. https://youtu.be/abBAyjATTHY 1970’s Spencer Haywood. You know why NBA players don’t have to go through four years of college, providing free labor for schools that make millions off their back? Because Spencer Haywood took them to court and won the right to enter the draft early. And he deserved to get in the game early because he was better than everyone else from his era with his thunderous dunks and ability to finish with either hand. His jump shot was sweet too. https://youtu.be/y0UAzzLksww 1960’s Jerry Sloan. He was arguably the greatest defender of all time. He was hard nosed, scrappy, and relentless on his way to six All NBA first or second team selections. https://youtu.be/2NTQGqX9q_s 1950’s Dolph Schayes. Obviously he suffers from the unfortunate bias of sharing a first name with Adolf Hitler. But don’t let that fool you. He was the games original innovator of positionless basketball. He was a forward that was tall for his era, but could kill you with his outside shot. If anyone doubts how smart of a player he was, just look at his aeronautical engineering degree. How else would you explain career averages of 18 points, 12 rebounds and 3 assists per game? https://youtu.be/EL2s7i86rog",1,0.055,0.826,0.119,0.9723,2.69

The name ""Bucks"" was chosen because “bucks are spirited, good jumpers, fast and agile”. Almost 45 years later Giannis enters the league doing his best impression of a buck – he’s definitely spirited, he can jump out the gym, and doing so all while being fast and agile.

So has a player eclipsed Giannis as the perfect embodiment of his team’s name? Let’s find out.

\*Disclaimer – some teams’ names are too abstract or “wild” to embody (how does one embody a thunder? And what the \*\*\*\* is a clipper?) so I had to bend the rules a little bit. Also, as a so-called “nephew”, I tried to choose only players who played in the last 30ish years.

nba,Chachimichonga,I hate how easily teams blame/fire coaches,2021-11-07 7:48:25 AM,"This year I've seen articles about almost every team thinking of firing their head coach. It makes no sense whatsoever. People seem to either have incredibly high expectations or think that hiring someone new will instantly fix all of the team's problems, even the ones that had nothing to do with coaching in the first place.

An example of this is Doc Rivers. Granted, he hasn't been perfect. But when it comes to this year's playoffs there were a lot of issues he couldn't do anything about. Joel's injury wasn't his fault. The fact that the 76ers have like 4 guys who play the same position and no real point guard wasn't his fault. Ben Simmons' awful playoffs performance wasn't his fault. I don't think Doc deserves the insane amount of hate he's been getting since their elimination or that he should automatically be fired because of it. It's funny how no one was complaining about him during the regular season when the 76ers were the number 1 seed. 

Another name that comes to mind is Mike Budenholzer. The Bucks were thinking about firing him last year after their loss to the Heat. They kept considering it throughout these playoffs as well, saying they'd probably replace him if the Bucks lost to the Nets. THE FRICKING NETS. The insanely loaded superstar team that everyone thought would sweep their way to the finals. It just doesn't seem fair. And I'm pretty sure we'll still be hearing those rumors if the Bucks don't end up winning the championship - despite the fact that Budenholzer got them to the finals for the first time since 1974.

And the list goes on. This ""get us a ring asap or your value as a coach will constantly be threatened and questioned"" mentality is ridiculous and I think it's actually hurting teams more than helping them.",t3_oi5s4i,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/oi5s4i/i_hate_how_easily_teams_blamefire_coaches/,0,46,t1_h4tca7v,2021-11-07 8:10:11 AM,"Lol the Bud apologist revisionist history.

CollegeBasketball,Armadillo_Dildo,"Interactive ""Power Projection"" Map",2021-09-07 9:27:11 AM,"I love checking up on the imperialism maps / the ""remaining undefeated teams"" maps throughout the season, so I've been working on my own version for the coming 2021-22 season: the [CBB ""Power Projection"" Map](https://imgur.com/urkj2Pg) (currently using the latest data from the end of the 2021 season).

In this map, each US county is assigned an ""owner"" based on who has the highest power projection score in that county. This score is calculated for each team in each county by taking their Kenpom Adj. EM and dividing it by the distance between the team's stadium and the nearest county border -- the result is that each county is controlled by the strongest nearby team, allowing teams to expand and protect their ""domain"" by playing better (and thus raising their Adj. EM throughout the season). In order to avoid making it too cluttered, I also imposed a rule that only the top 30 teams (by Adj. EM) could own land; this is pretty arbitrary though so if you think it should be different let me know. 

You can explore the map (and see which non-landed teams are within each team's domain) using this interactive version I made:

> https://werdna63.shinyapps.io/ncaa-maps/#section-power-projection-map

(It should work on mobile, but it's probably going to look a lot better on a desktop / laptop)

It also includes a data viewing tool that lets you view the total land area, water area, population, etc. of each team's ""domain"" (you can even export the tables to a .CSV or a .PDF!). It should update automatically after each game since it draws the data directly from Kenpom.com too!

I'm posting this here now because I wanted to see if anyone had any feedback / recommendations for how I could improve this before the season starts; I also might throw something similar together for college football since that's coming up even sooner. If this is something you think would be fun / if you have any feedback it would be appreciated!",t3_ogz54c,https://www.reddit.com/r/CollegeBasketball/comments/ogz54c/interactive_power_projection_map/,50,30,t1_h4m4mvg,2021-09-07 10:43:52 AM,I'm not sure about UVa owning eastern NC ..

CollegeBasketball,10_Tree,"Parity Comparison: Premier League vs. Hypothetical Top Division College Basketball Teams, 2003-04 Through 2021-22",2021-09-07 3:41:41 PM,"Implementing a promotion/relegation system for college basketball is a terrible idea. Using recent statistics to retrodict what would have happened if a major, fundamental change had occurred in the past is lazy, misleading, and often uninformative. So, naturally, I wanted to find out what the (Division I Men's) college basketball landscape might look like if it had a promotion/relegation system exactly the same as the English Football Pyramid.
&#x200B;
The English pyramid scheme promises 7,000+ teams that they could win the national title in within 11 years or so if they just do well enough, but the champion winds up being the same 5 or 6 teams all the time. I figure college basketball has got to be more volatile than that, right? So this could be interesting?
&#x200B;
I used the Massey College Basketball Ranking Composite from the final week of each year to retrodict how well each team would do compared to the other teams in their league, with teams then promoted/relegated according to the current rules of the English pyramid scheme, with the exception that we only need 8 levels instead of 11 to cover all of the Division I Men's Basketball teams. For college hoops, Massey only goes back to the 2002-03 season, so I used that year to determine which of the 15 leagues in the 8 different levels each team gets to start, and I'm only retrodicting starting with the 2003-04 season. This is clearly the best time period to use, the best ranking to use, the best promotion/relegation system to use, and the best way to determine the starting position for each team, and anyone who disagrees with me isn't worth arguing against, because they have no grasp of written sarcasm.
&#x200B;
Using this method, the actual, real-life champion of the NCAA Tournament each year would have been competing in the top league every year except for the infamously wild 2011 tournament, when UConn would have been in the second-best league. OK, that's not 100% true - UNC got a rough starting spot in the third level in 2003-04 and didn't have enough time to make it to the top league for their tourney win the next year, but that's a weird artifact of how I chose the starting positions and not a reflection on the parity of college basketball. When everything settled down, it seemed that only maybe 20 teams out of 350+ are realistically capable of winning the tourney in any given year, or maybe 25 in really wild years without strong top teams. Less than 10% of the teams competing. Doesn't seem great... until you compare it with the English football.
&#x200B;
51 basketball teams would spend time in the top level of our fantasy realm, with 12 of them winning the top league at some point in the 18 year period. The actual Premier League featured only 41 teams over the same time period, with only 6 of them winning the league, including the once-in-a-generation accomplishment of underdogs Leicester City. So college basketball tends to have more teams in with a chance at a championship any given year and to rotate those teams out from year-to-year more often than English football. I show a comparison below, with teams currently in the top league going into 2021-22 highlighted in green. And if you look across the row, you might find a soccer team that can torture you in the same way as your basketball team! Isn't cross-cultural misery wonderful?
&#x200B;

Of course, there is another way to compare parity between these two sports. In England, only the top 90ish teams are fully professional. So, instead of comparing the 350 Division I teams giving out scholarships to all 7,000+ soccer teams in England, maybe it's more fair to compare them to just the professional teams? In England, 6 of the top 92 teams have a realistic shot at the title. That's 6.5%, and 6.5% of 350 teams is about 23 teams... so do we actually have as much parity, within the whole of Division I, as English football? Do we just think we have more parity because we have more teams, and never think about any team (other than our own) outside the top 100? Something to think about.
&#x200B;
But with more teams in general, and still only one champion, there is more mystery and intrigue about who will be champion in any given year. And it's more exciting to have a tournament that any team could qualify for, where teams without title hopes could still pull off the upset of the century that they can remember more fondly than the top teams recall a championship a decade ago! We can ignore that England also does this exact same thing in their Cup competitions and put off consideration of the extent to which innately unevenly distributed resources translates into sporting success independent of sport or tactics for another day, since this post is already long enough.

It just makes sense In a lot of ways it didn't come from the NBA instead the other way around. The vast majority of basketball isn't played in the NBA, so it makes sense that a lot of the innovation ends up happening elsewhere. Nick Nurse and Mike D'Antoni came up with their unusual styles in Europe, a lot of pace and space started in low level college programmes, and the women's game has been hoisting a lot of 3s in recent years As for some of those other things, it depends more. In college it's less likely that you have multiple athletic wings, so switching is harder, and it's harder to find a big with NBA size and ability so often if you have one they will be featured more prominently. Simply because there's a strong chance that the other team doesn't have a player like that In the women's game, size is a bigger advantage than in the men's game. Due to the decreased physical athleticism and speed, it's simply harder to make up for size. A lot more of the game is played through the post, and while many of the women's games best players are guards, it's comparatively harder for them to attack bigs and the offensive shift to perimeter creation has been less drastic The international game is mixed. They often play more through their bigs, partially due to the same reasons above of not having the same athletes on the perimeter, fewer high quality bigs with size, and more physicality on the perimeter. But international play has also long been ahead of the NBA, spread pick and roll was the normal overseas long before the NBA. They often play with a smaller more athletic 5, or a skilled 5 simply because that's what was available and that's what a lot of overseas leagues create",32,0.036,0.875,0.089,0.9418,5.89

nba,Icy_Elephant_6370,[Serious] Does a Ben Simmons to MN trade even make sense without a third team?,2021-12-07 10:51:30 AM,"TL:DR: assuming KAT/Ant/DLo are untouchable (for reasons explained below), the Wolves realistically lack a package the Sixers, who are trying to win now, would want. On this line of thinking, a third team is necessary to send a star player to the Sixers and receive assets from the Wolves for Simmons. But finding a third team that is willing to give up a star player and accept long-term assets is also difficult. I don’t have an answer, just discussing/brainstorming. The Simmons to MN chatter started almost immediately following the Sixers’ exit from the playoffs. With confirmation from Wolves beat writers that they will intensely pursue Simmons, and the two teams discussing a trade (albeit, not yet substantively), the discussion seems to be gaining momentum. He would undeniably be a great fit on the Wolves. His elite defense/defensive versatility, playmaking, and rebounding would significantly help raise the floor of a Twolves team that lacks all three. All else equal, a starting 5 of DLo-Ant-McDaniels-Simmons-KAT could be a very real playoff team. And a KAT/Simmons pairing would complement each other almost perfectly. The big question is what it takes to get him and finding a mutually beneficial trade. While his value is at an all-time low, he’s still a 24 year old 3x all-star, 2x first-team defender and DPOY runner up. While his shooting woes are undeniable, his skill otherwise is similarly undeniable. Any realistic trade scenario for Simmons would be expensive. There’s no world where some combo of Culver/Rubio/firsts (or whatever other bullshit low-ball ideas people like to come up with) would work. So what does a trade for Simmons look like? Thinking about the Sixers’ current situation: Embiid is 27, injury-prone, and playing at an MVP level. He’s in his prime, but with his injury history, there’s no way to know how long that prime lasts. The Sixers want to win now. If they were to trade Simmons, it wouldn’t make sense for them to accept a package centered around future assets. What they need is an established offensive star that they can pair with Embiid and get immediate returns. Given their current situation, I just don’t see what the Wolves have to offer that would entice the Sixers in a two-team trade. Let’s consider the Timberwolves’ current assets:
- KAT- Untouchable, probably not even worth including in the discussion. - DLo- DLo is an intriguing option. While he’s not a good defender and not particularly athletic, he is solid playmaker, good 3 point shooter, and can create his own shot at all three levels. He would slot in well next to Embiid as a second option on offense who can space the floor. But I don’t see this one happening. Simmons is more valuable than DLo, and I’m not sure DLo is enough to move the needle for the Sixers. Moreover, the Timberwolves seem particularly disinclined to trade him, viewing him as a core piece of the Wolves and going to great lengths to acquire him in the first place. - Ant- The discussion on Ant is a bit more nuanced. Yes, he has a ton of value, but I also think the Wolves and Sixers probably view his value differently. Simmons is currently way more valuable than Ant, I am not trying to argue otherwise. But if you look at the Timberwolves’ current needs, and Ant’s potential, he’s probably viewed as untouchable in the context of a Simmons trade. He’s a big, athletic wing with a great handle who can create his own shot. That’s the archetype every NBA team is looking for right now. 2-3 years from now, I think there’s a non-zero chance Ant is better than Simmons currently is, and given how bad the Wolves are, I think they almost have to gamble that Ant does develop that way. I also think the Sixers probably view Ant as having less value, compared to the Wolves’ perception of him. They are looking for an impact player/star right now. A 19 year old with 30 games of good NBA basketball under his belt doesn’t really fit that mold, and it would be a huge gamble on the Sixers’ part to do an Edwards-centered trade if what they’re looking for is a player who can slot in and have a big impact next year. - Malik Beasley. One of the few not “untouchable” positive assets the Wolves have. He doesn’t have a good handle and cant reliably create his own shot, but he’s a high-energy player and an absolute flamethrower from 3. But he’s more of a roleplayer than a guy you can look to help carry an offense, which it seems is what the Sixers need. For that reason, I don’t think Beasley really moves the needle for the Sixers either. - Jaden McDaniels. Already an elite defender with a reliable 3-pt shot (36% from 3 his rookie year). In addition to his defensive prowess, he’s also flashed some upside on offense with a nice handle and the ability to (unreliably) create his own shot. A highly valuable asset, but again, I don’t think he does much for the Sixers in the context of a Simmons trade, considering the fact that they’re likely looking for a star. He could be a nice add-in to a larger package, but that’s about it.
- Naz Reid. Second year backup center on an absurdly team-friendly deal. Excellent scorer, capable defender, although somewhat undersized. Think Trez Harrell-lite with a 3 pt shot. Again, he could be a nice add-in in a larger package, but he doesn’t move the needle for the Sixers. - Ricky Rubio. Veteran PG with playoff experience on an expiring contract. Smart, excellent playmaker, solid defender, although his athleticism inhibits him on that end. Not sure why the Sixers would have interest though, given his lack of scoring prowess. That’s kind of the list of positive assets the Timberwolves have. Could they cobble together some combo of DLo/Beasley/McDaniels/Reid and future firsts to put together an acceptable offer? Maybe, but other teams would be able to easily beat that offer. Moreover, for the Sixers, it would be like trading a dollar for four quarters. Why give up an all-star and elite defender for a handful of players that, summed up, might not even be as valuable as Simmons is?
So then, my thinking goes to three team trades: MN sending assets to a third team, the Sixers sending Simmons to MN (and potentially assets to the third team), the third team trading their star to Philly. I don’t think there are a ton of viable options, because you need a team that has a star-level player that is willing to trade that player, and is also willing to take on future assets as compensation, i.e. get worse in the short-term. Maybe it’s Dame or CJ. Maybe it’s Beal. Maybe it’s a Lowry sign and trade, I really have no idea. But at that rate, why wouldn’t the Sixers just send Simmons + assets to a team that actually has a star they want? A scenario including MN and a third team where the third team gives up a star and MN gets Simmons completely waters down the value of the third team being involved in the first place. To me, it just doesn’t seem like there’s even a remotely realistic way for the Twolves to get Simmons. The Wolves clearly want Simmons, and Simmons would clearly be a great fit. But it doesn’t seem like MN has players they would be willing to trade that the Sixers would also have interest in, and involving a third team obviates the need for MN to be involved in the first place.",t3_oiwi3m,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/oiwi3m/serious_does_a_ben_simmons_to_mn_trade_even_make/,16,49,t1_h4y5q28,2021-12-07 11:26:00 AM,"The prospect of Simmons, Towns and Edwards does sound pretty amazing if I’m being honest.

nba,KingOfKetchup,Is it now safe to say Lebron isn’t a top 5 player,2021-12-07 4:26:59 AM,"Now before I list my consensus top 5, remember that this NOW. I’m a neutral fan and appreciate Lebron as a player. I even believe he’s at least the 2nd best player already and still has a very good chance to be the best.

Now, here’s my 5 (in random order)

- Steph Curry

- Kawhi Leonard

- Kevin Durant

- Giannis Antetokounmpo

- James Harden

This is assuming they are all healthy of course.

For Steph, his gravity and how he shaped the league really gives a lasting impression on him. The great thing is he can back it up through his unbelievable performance. When stars shoot lights out 3 for a game, it will always be compared to Curry because he does it on a nightly basis.

For Kawhi, he’s probably the scariest player to face right now. I watched how he carried the Clippers effortlessly in the Mavs series. He’s closest to how dominant Lebron was during his prime

For KD, we’ve been robbed of 35ppg KD because you already know. The Nets series just proved he can carry any team in the playoffs

For Giannis, I think it’s his inconsistency and his glaring weakness that don’t put him in this list. In this finals, he’s proven he can and if he continues his dominant performance, it’s an easy lock

For Harden, I’ve watched how he carried Rockets throughout the years. Yes he has not yet put up James Harden series which pretty much excludes him from other’s list. However, he’s looking like the best player of the Nets when he was healthy. That shows a lot

Outside the 5, we still have Luka, Jokic, Embiid who when healthy can make a case on their own as well",t3_oipbqy,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/oipbqy/is_it_now_safe_to_say_lebron_isnt_a_top_5_player/,0,92,t1_h4wqknk,2021-12-07 4:28:05 AM,lmao,7,0,0,1,0.5994,10

They don't do college hoops any more (at least I don't think they do) but any games on NBC Sports Network were not a good production. 2. Gallagher Iba is an iconic arena with a lot of good history and fun games in its past, but the way it's built makes the cameras way too high for my preference in tv viewing. 3. I'll watch just about any two teams play as long as it's competitive. So for worst matchup I'll say Kentucky vs Chaminade. 4. There are calls that get missed in every game, but overall the officiating is still very good in D1 basketball. I don't really care who is wearing the stripes. 5. Nantz is very good at what he does but his style is too laid back for me. For color commentary, I'd like to avoid Jay Bilas and his ""I'm smarter than you, therefore my opinion should count more"" attitude. 6.

CollegeBasketball,dragonice81,NIL could be the best possible thing for College Basketball,2021-01-07 6:27:17 AM,"Since the NBA changed their draft eligibility rules in 2006 college basketball has been ruled by the one-and-done stars. From Kevin Durant to Zion Williamson, the sport has become enraptured with players who are essentially biding their time waiting for their opportunity for a paycheck. I don't think anyone is going to claim that a player like KD or Zion would have stayed in college for longer if they were getting paid, but there's a whole other class of player that I think will weigh that decision very differently. 

Examine a player like Dayton's Obi Toppin. He burst onto the scene as a freshman and quickly ascended to stardom. The loss of the 2020 Tournament will forever remain the great what-if for Dayton fans, but what if Toppin could have cashed in on his NPOY season and stayed in college another season or two? Would be be talking about Dayton's Final Four run in the 2021 Tournament? Maybe that's worth more to him than being drafted eighth overall by the Knicks. 

NIL presents an option for star college players to stay in college without having to choose between millions of dollars and absolutely nothing. Sure, one-and-done isn't going away unless the NBA changes their rules, but I do think that giving players the option to cash in on college stardom may incentivize longer stints at the college level. And that is a very good thing for college basketball fans.",t3_obltts,https://www.reddit.com/r/CollegeBasketball/comments/obltts/nil_could_be_the_best_possible_thing_for_college/,112,99,t1_h3or36t,2021-01-07 7:37:49 AM,NBA should allow kids to go straight from HS.

CollegeBasketball,Armadillo_Dildo,"Interactive ""Power Projection"" Map",2021-09-07 9:27:11 AM,"I love checking up on the imperialism maps / the ""remaining undefeated teams"" maps throughout the season, so I've been working on my own version for the coming 2021-22 season: the [CBB ""Power Projection"" Map](https://imgur.com/urkj2Pg) (currently using the latest data from the end of the 2021 season).

In this map, each US county is assigned an ""owner"" based on who has the highest power projection score in that county. This score is calculated for each team in each county by taking their Kenpom Adj. EM and dividing it by the distance between the team's stadium and the nearest county border -- the result is that each county is controlled by the strongest nearby team, allowing teams to expand and protect their ""domain"" by playing better (and thus raising their Adj. EM throughout the season). In order to avoid making it too cluttered, I also imposed a rule that only the top 30 teams (by Adj. EM) could own land; this is pretty arbitrary though so if you think it should be different let me know. 

You can explore the map (and see which non-landed teams are within each team's domain) using this interactive version I made:

> https://werdna63.shinyapps.io/ncaa-maps/#section-power-projection-map

(It should work on mobile, but it's probably going to look a lot better on a desktop / laptop)

It also includes a data viewing tool that lets you view the total land area, water area, population, etc. of each team's ""domain"" (you can even export the tables to a .CSV or a .PDF!). It should update automatically after each game since it draws the data directly from Kenpom.com too!

I'm posting this here now because I wanted to see if anyone had any feedback / recommendations for how I could improve this before the season starts; I also might throw something similar together for college football since that's coming up even sooner.

nbadiscussion,XenaRen,Using Simmons as a way to get off the Tobias Harris contract,2021-22-06 5:35:13 PM,"Ok, so it's pretty obvious at this point that Simmons is gonna be traded. Morey's been wanting to do this ever since he arrived in Philly but after that loss to Atlanta, the general consensus seems to be that his value has dropped significantly - to the point where CJ McCollum may be the best return they can get. A trio of Embiid, McCollum and Harris would be pretty good but ultimately it won't be enough to beat a healthy Nets team or a rejuvenated Lakers. 

As an alternative, what if the Sixers add Tobias Harris to a potential Simmons trade and get a lesser return but clear up enough cap space to go after any one (or two) of the marquee free agents in 2022? Harden, KD, Curry, Beal, Butler, Kawhi, Kyrie and LaVine could all be in that class, depending on what some of them do with their player options. It'd be insanely risky since Philly could very well wind up with none of them on their team, which would most certainly lead to an Embiid trade demand down the road, but the payoff would be immense. 

To be perfectly clear, this is not at all a commentary on Harris. He was pretty good for the Sixers all throughout the playoffs but his contract is just too large for someone who, at his peak, is the third best player on a championship team. A potential Simmons trade presents a good opportunity for the Sixers to move off of that.",t3_o61g8x,https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/o61g8x/using_simmons_as_a_way_to_get_off_the_tobias/,2,12,t1_h2pr20k,2021-22-06 5:43:08 PM,The problem is who are you going to get back. Simmons and Harris combine for like 60 million dollars and you have to wonder whether or not the players you get back will be better than those two. This is why it's tricky because you can't afford to fuck around and waste another season since Embiid's health is always a factor and he's a free agent in 2023.,14,0.091,0.76,0.149,0.6652,6.49
nbadiscussion,RichHomi3Saquon,Ben Simmons to the Brooklyn Nets (and why it makes too much sense),2021-27-06 8:37:10 PM,"I know, I know. It sounds crazy, but there is a scenario where the Nets and the Sixers both come out as huge winners in this trade!

I’ll outline the deal here:

**Nets receive:**

Ben Simmons

**Sixers receive:**

Spencer Dinwiddie (sign and trade, 4 yr $17 mil per)

Joe Harris

2021 1st round pick

2028 1st round pick

#How the Nets Win

The Nets have 3 all time scorers. They need defense. Ben Simmons is an elite 1-5 defender who can also distribute if necessary. On offense, Ben can play in the dunker spot and chill. On defense, he can go all out and be Draymond Green on steroids.

Very easy win.

#How the Sixers Win

The Sixers need two things really badly. They need to surround Embiid with shooters, and they need a primary ball handler who can shoot. Dinwiddie can easily be their primary ball handler and can feed Embiid in the post. That’s all they need, plus, Dinwiddie is a stud scorer in my eyes. Not elite, but in this scenario, we’re trying to commit 110% to helping Embiid lead the Sixers to a championship.

Joe Harris is a bonafide sniper. He can hit threes consistently and would instantly be their best shooter.

Even if you don’t think that’s enough, the two first round picks should get it to about even in my eyes.

#Overall

Neither team takes on or frees up any salary cap, so there is no financial struggle with this trade. This trade is a win-win all around. If I’m Sean Marks or Daryl Morey, I am trying to bang out this deal as soon as possible. It improves both teams by a lot.

They know that if you tune in for the start at 9pm you’ll watch to the end and it’s not their problem that you’re up late. They know if they say 9pm and start at 920 they can show you more ads. Therefore it’s optimal to put the games on Tu/Thu/one of Sat/Sun to maximize 18-34yo viewers that command ad premium. There are 2 days off between games not 3. Everyone agrees that 4 games in 7 days is a lot for players so why would they do that and lose revenue at the same time? They want discussion and hype, optimal viewing dates for ads, and players want the days off for a better on court product.",1,0.034,0.821,0.145,0.9638,2.95
nbadiscussion,2001hardknocks,The NBA needs to re-think and re-format the scheduling of the NBA Finals!,2021-08-07 6:13:56 AM,"Being on the East Coast, having the NBA Finals begin at 9pm every night is quite annoying and highly inconvenient. But I get why the NBA does it. They want to be fair to both Coasts and give viewers on both sides a fair chance of catching the game. That's fine. That's something they have to do. Get the primetime viewers across the country. 

BUT WHY THE HECK do they have 3 days scheduled between games for each of Game 3, 4, 5 and 6. That's ludicrous! I can't see the point in doing that. It unnecessarily prolongs the Finals by a week or more, if the series goes 6 or 7 games. It's just so dumb.

Personally speaking that much gap kills the momentum of the series. As a neutral fan, I lose interest and/or forget the storylines because so much else can fill up the space between games.

Is there a reason the NBA does this? Has there ever been an official reasoning?",t3_og6y9v,https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/og6y9v/the_nba_needs_to_rethink_and_reformat_the/,1,8,t1_h4h3t2m,2021-08-07 7:07:50 AM,"Most likely it keeps people talking about the NBA for longer.

nbadiscussion,Desmondo110,A comparison of FTA per 36 in the Regular Season vs. Post Season 2015 - 2021,2021-01-07 9:22:03 AM,"The NBA announced that it would be changing the rules to help curb some of the unnatural motion that players use to game the rules and draw fouls. The announcement specifically called out Trae Young and James Harden, but this could also be applied to many other foul baiters, like Joel Embiid, Chris Paul, and Kevin Durant. During the post season, it is not uncommon to see these master baiters complain to the refs after not getting a call that they may have gotten dozens of times in the regular season or earlier rounds of the playoffs. Are these players actually getting fewer fouls called for them in the post season compared to the regular season?
I wanted to determine if the players are actually getting fewer fouls in the post season. Using Basketball Reference player statistics for the regular season and post season dating back to 2015, I tried to accomplish just that. To take out any bias that might be created by small sample sizes, I removed any player-season, where the player played fewer than 500 regular season minutes and fewer than 80 post season minutes. I then calculated the number of FTA per 36 minutes in the regular season and the post season for each player-year. I then created a scatter plot with the X-axis as regular season FTA per 36 and Y-axis of post season FTA per 36. If players were getting fouled at the same rate in the regular season as the post season, a linear regression would have a slope of 1, so I added this ideal line to the chart in black. I also added the actual linear regression line to the chart, which can be seen below in blue:
&#x200B;
https://preview.redd.it/mt7s5l2efm871.png?width=561&format=png&auto=webp&s=830325af553aa1fa5bf2b8ec534417fff4474301
The linear regression model has slope of 0.91 and an intercept of 0.23, which indicates that a theoretical player who draws zero fouls per 36 in the regular season would draw .23 fouls per 36 in the post season. On the flip side, a player that leads the league in fouls drawn in the regular season would have the biggest drop in FTA in the playoffs. This can be seen by how the blue linear regression line clearly starts to deviate away from the ideal line at around 5 FTA per 36. It appears as if players that draw few fouls in the regular season are being rewarded with additional FTA in the post season and players that drew more fouls in the regular season are being punished with fewer FTA in the playoffs. This effect is likely the result of a combination of factors: defenders learning more of the offensive players foul baiting tricks over the course of a 7 game series and refs changing how they ref in the post season, and ""letting the players play."" It begs to the question if refs should ref the same way in the regular season and post season?
Some fun statistical nuggets from this analysis:
* In 2017 Dewayne Dedmon shot nearly 12 FTs per 36 in the playoffs after shooting 2.5 in the regular season. He made just over half of them.
* In 2020 Joel Embiid shot the highest number of FTs per 36 in the last 6 seasons, 14.6 because the Boston Celtics tried to defend him Daniel Theis and Enes Kanter. The Celtics still swept the series.
* Of the top 10 highest FTA per 36 in the regular season, Giannis in 2021 has the worst ratio of post season to regular season free throw attempts. 10.4 FTA/36 in the regular season compared to 7.8 FTA/36 in the post season.",t3_obpavr,https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/obpavr/a_comparison_of_fta_per_36_in_the_regular_season/,17,6,t1_h3pcyex,2021-01-07 10:20:06 AM,"This was super interesting. I wonder if poor free throw shooters being intentionally fouled contributes to the increase in free-throws for players who don't take a lot. I haven't done any real thorough research but quick glancing at Basketball reference revealed that some of the worst ft shooters in modern history i could think of, Drummond, DJ and Simmons all saw increases in attempts. Also that outlier at around 10 ft attempts who goes up to around 15, is that Jimmy?",3,0.089,0.818,0.093,-0.3818,2.43
nbadiscussion,krs196,Stars that may be traded that may be surprising.,2021-09-07 2:44:45 PM,"This summer, with the free agency market lacking big time, it seems likely most teams will try to improve via the draft or trade.
And while this draft has some legit star talent at the top you may see one or two teams trade a older star to get, most will try to get a star from a trade.
I was working out who may be available, including people we may not expect. We have all heard about maybe Simmons or Lillard and Beal seems like he'll be an option, at least in people's heads, so if any of them got traded it really wouldn't be too surprising.
So the question became: **Is there anyone who has an actual possible shot of being traded (i.e. not Doncic nonsense trades) that may not be someone people expect but - in a market that may see teams bidding against each other and thus, driving up prices on talent - could still be dealt?**
Here's a list of people I think qualify for this:
- **KAT**
**Why yes**: The Wolves have been/are perpetually kind of a mess. I'm not sure where I'd rank KAT in the NBA, atm, but I can see a team talking themselves into his potential to improve (whether its there or not). The Wolves may decide to truly blow everything up and shed salary as they try to sell the team. Also, with all that's happened in his life during the pandemic, he may just want a change of scenery.
**Why no**: He may like the low-key nature of Minny, and with all that has happened in his life, he may enjoy playing with his friend D-Lo more than leaving for somewhere else. Also, while a lot of new owners like blowing things up, KAT is still young enough to be a building block.
**Possible teams**:
**Knicks** - They have Mitch, but I think KAT has more potential and it would allow him to be closer to his hometown. It could be a move for the Knicks where they get someone with star potential without having to give up the farm.
**Jazz** - Jazz don't usually make flashy moves, but I think him and Gobert could coexist without getting in each other's way too much. KAT may like playing PF too and the Jazz could provide some franchise stability. It'd be a bit of an old-school lineup but sometimes going against the grain can surprise teams. Engles could be flexed where needed as well.
**Washington** - The Wizards thinking they are closer to conention than they are and deciding to keep everyone AND deciding to give up way too much for KAT wouldn't even register as surprising to me.
- **Jrue Holiday**
**Why yes**: While Jrue did well for them, if they don't like how the Finals go down and can package him in a deal for a better player, they may go for it.
**Why no**: He has played well for them during the season, and the Bucks would likely make a coaching change before overhauling big parts of the roster. Also, sunk cost fallacy.
**Possible teams**:
**Blazers** - This would be an improvement. Blazers could take him on as part of a package and figure to trade him later or try to contend still now. Lillard with Giannis and Middleton would be scary, but issue is what else can Bucks give at this point in a trade?
**Depth** - I'm putting this here to encompass a number of possibilities with the basic idea being that maybe they can get 3 players that, while none are as good as Jrue, together they can help the team more.
- **Chris Paul**
**Why yes**: The Suns may end up winning the title, but Chris isn't getting younger and if some team wants to throw $100 mil.+ at him, the Suns may be appreciative of his help but not stupid.
With Booker, Bridges, Ayton, the Suns will be contenders still in the future, especially if they can get a decent haul. With a sign and trade, Paul could go to a team he wants, even if they don't have the cap room to get him in free agency.
Sarver may not want to pay high-dollar for their core 4.
**Why no**: Umm, the Suns are two games from the their first Finals victory ever. It's easy to assume the Suns young talent will continue to improve, but it's not always a given, and so why screw things up now?
**Possible teams**:
**Knicks** - He's expressed desire to play their before and he could really help them make a deeper playoff push. If he's willing to take a 3 yr deal for say 90 mil., and the Knicks don't have to give up more than a couple of assets, I could see this being possible for them.
**Bucks** - Remember what I said about the Jrue improvement? This could be a way to improve with the limited assets Bucks still have.
**Lakers** - I don't think the Lakers can be ruled out this off-season from big moves, and it wouldn't surprise me if Paul hits that sweet spot of they have enough to get him/him being a big help for the team.
Though, it's possible the Suns don't want to help a title rival, they may also recognize that rival would be built in part around some admittedly older stars.
- **Siakam**
**Why yes**: This goes back to what I said at the start; while the Raptors may not be inclined to trade him, if enough teams want to get stupid about it, they may decide he has platued and it's worth it to trade him while they can get so much.
**Why no**: It may just be he's better as a 2nd star and the Raptors like the core they have and want to build with him still, because again, despite any narratives atm, he's really good.
**Possible teams**:
**Warriors** - We've seen the rumored offer, but it really depends on how much the Raptors like Wiseman.
**Mavs** - I could see Dallas sending 4 firsts or more and Kristaps to get him in the type of move other contenders have made for stars. Would it be the right move for them? Ehhh, maybe?
While Kemba, Kristaps, McCollum all may be traded, they aren't on the level of the others above.
One team to watch out for: **The Hawks**.
The Hawks are ready to take the leap but are superstar hunting at this point, and have the assets to do so. I think they wait though until next off-season and see if the situations with Embiid, Giannis, or Doncic implode first before making all-in move.

I think they’re probably trying hard to get Simmons with DLo but if he is traded it has to be a blockbuster trade almost AD like. With the injuries and his lack of support, people have forgotten how good he is but I think nearly every team would want to trade for him if he is available. 2) They put like 4/5 picks for Jrue, they aren’t trading him but he just hasn’t got it going offensively. CJ could be an interesting fit as they do need a more offensive playmaker but with his contract it’s not really a positive contract where they can get back great depth too. 3) CP3 is a Free Agent and he’s going to chase the money which he rightfully should. Suns would be stupid to let him go and I think they’ll give him that and they’ll run it back. CP3 would be great with Middleton/Giannis but Suns aren’t taking on Jrue. Lakers have no chance of CP3 even Lowry and I’m a Lakers fan. 4). Siakam is in that FVV/Boucher timeline, I don’t see why Raptors would trade him unless for a young potential superstar. Dallas have time on their side with Luka has to be a calculated play and I don’t think Siakam moves the needle enough to sacrifice that many assets",12,0.101,0.705,0.194,0.9792,5.94

In my opinion, it could go either way. Siakam is a cornerstone of the team and has many great years ahead of him. But this trade could be a possible power move for the team. They could end up like the 87’ Bulls ( Getting Scottie Pippen and Horace Grant in the same draft ) and have a bright future as a team with two very talented players, as well as James Wiseman, who also has a lot of potential as a player. 

Personally though, I do think they should play it safe. I’m a little biased since Siakam is my favourite player on the Raptors, but he is currently one of the best players on the team. I also don’t think the 4th pick will have an immediate impact on the team, so they’ll probably get another high draft pick next year.",t3_odw2nc,https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/odw2nc/whats_your_thoughts_on_the_rumoured_siakam_trade/,517,432,t1_h44qcfu,2021-05-07 7:24:44 AM,"I think if the Raptors are sure Kyle Lowry is leaving, it could make sense to start a rebuild.

The Jazz won't even commit to developing two really good power forward prospects in Juwan Morgan and Jarrell Brantley.

nbadiscussion,warboner65,Adam Silver and kowtowing to the players: when will it end?,2021-03-07 3:47:49 PM,"Adam Silver is by all accounts very pro- ""player power."" He clearly wants to be seen as a friend of the players, and he's particularly careful not to offend star players.

This approach is by and large lauded by NBA media, which identifies with players over and above the the league or regular NBA fans (it also has a tendency to view these issues through a political lens, and suggest that anti-player-power attitudes are the product of some sort of racism). 

There are dissenting voices in the media though. One obvious example is Bill Simmons. Though he *used* to be in favour of Silver's ""the players are always right"" attitude, of late he's done a 180 (correctly imo). You'll hear Russillo and him actually provide pushback and stress, essentially, that ""something must be done.""

My question is: **will something be done?** For those of us who think Silver is WAY too much of an overcorrection from Stern, **will we ever get to the point where someone's going to put their foot down and address some of the player-power related problems (we all know what they are) in the league?**

nbadiscussion,Guwop25,[OC] How the Bucks slowed down Trae Young in Game 2,2021-26-06 4:57:42 AM,"I've been writing tons of NBA articles recently, so here's a film breakdown I did on the defense played against Trae in Game 2. Hope you can get something out of it.

EDIT: Removed the 2nd video because it wasn't a great example.
***
Trae Young has been having a historic playoff run that reached its peak in Game 1 where he had a career night with 48 points. The Bucks were able to slow Young down in Game 2 to even the series at one apiece. Young had just 15 points on 6/16 shooting, 1/8 from three, and had 9 turnovers. Let's take a look at how he was brought back down to earth.

Young has been abusing the drop coverage in the pick and roll all postseason, attacking the slow-footed center and either letting his patented floater go or tossing the lob to his roll man, most often Clint Capela. 

Here, Giannis Antetokounmpo's length prevents Young from getting the floater up so Brook Lopez can stay back a little more to cover Capela, Jrue Holiday is also there behind Lopez to ensure there isn't an opportunity for the lob. Because of Holiday's soft double team on Capela, Lopez doesn't have to worry about guarding Trae and Capela at the same time, so he's right there to get the block on Young's layup attempt.

Trae runs the pick and roll with John Collins and Lopez again plays drop coverage but thanks to Giannis coming over to help on Collins, Lopez doesn't have to worry about the lob threat and can focus mostly on preventing Trae's floater. He gets a great contest on it and the shot is off.

Holiday once again is aggressive on defense, picking Young up at half court. This lack of aggression in Game 1 is what allowed Young to go off. Holiday does make a bad decision in reaching around Trae's back for the steal, allowing him to get free temporarily and into the mid-range. With PJ Tucker and Giannis on the block to help, he had no driving lane and was forced into a tough mid-range shot over the outstretched arm of Lopez. Young actually missed Collins, who was open in the corner.

Young tries to run the pick and roll with Capela, Holiday goes over the screen, Giannis drops off of Kevin Huerter to take away Capela as a lob threat, Khris Middleton comes over to trap Young and take away any potential shot attempt. He gets stuck in the air and loses it out of bounds.

VIDEO: https://streamable.com/pr7erj


Holiday comes over the screen tightly and Young tries to draw the foul, but as he realises that Holiday is way too far away for the referee's to call it, he's forced to pass it while in mid air and it goes straight to Tucker. Holiday gets out on the other end for the easy two points.

VIDEO: https://streamable.com/2ujuad

This is just poor decision making from Trae. An off balance lob pass from the logo where Tucker was right behind Collins and Lopez was in perfect position to jump in front of it and intercept it. I don't know what read Trae saw because there was never a chance of this working out. It was most likely out of frustration as the Bucks got out on a run.

VIDEO: https://streamable.com/2khufa

Here is a fantastic read from Middleton. He sees Bogdan Bogdanovic coming off the down screen set by Danilo Gallinari and knew Young was going to hit him for the open three, but he jumps the passing lane and gets out for two points on the other end.

VIDEO: https://streamable.com/mpb1tf

Trae is hounded by Holiday coming off of the high screen, Trae tries the bounce pass into Collins at the free throw line but Holiday's quick hands allows him to pick it off. Even if the pass got through, the possession likely still would've resulted in a turnover as Collins would've been in a tight spot with Middleton, Holiday, and Lopez all right there.

Another high screen and roll with Collins. Tucker comes in to block the lane for Collins to roll, forcing him to pop out to the three-point line. Middleton does a great job of helping and putting pressure on Young. Trae looks up to the rim to see if he can get a shot off, but Lopez is right up in his grill. He sees Collins open for three at the top, but Holiday's lightning-quick rotation gets Trae stuck in the air, where he throws it straight to Tucker. This is a perfect example of needing a whole team to slow down the opposing star. 4 players played a crucial part in forcing the turnover here. I think this is the best defensive possession on Young through this entire postseason.

The Bucks did a fantastic job with their aggression, forcing him into sloppy turnovers and tough jump shots.


All post-season, Trae has been punishing teams for playing drop coverage. But the Bucks played it a little differently tonight. They were using extra defenders on the pick and roll coverage, so as not to leave Lopez vulnerable, having to guard Capela and Young at the same time, which is what happened in Game 1 and both the Knicks and 76ers series. They were making sure they always had an extra defender there to take away the lob threat or the floater threat, leaving Trae with just one option instead of two. Lopez would also play up higher on the pick and roll, often coming out to the free throw line instead of dropping all the way back to the restricted area like he did in Game 1.


They made it a priority to trap Trae, putting him in the tightest spaces possible and because Trae is a small guard, it was a struggle for him to make the pass out of it despite his superb playmaking abilities.


If the Bucks can keep trapping Young, forcing him into making tough passes and keep playing good help defense with drop coverage, then they should be confident about their ability to keep Trae Young at bay and win this series.",t3_o89ewr,https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/o89ewr/oc_how_the_bucks_slowed_down_trae_young_in_game_2/,611,69,t1_h36l6ee,2021-26-06 10:08:10 PM,"OP i have one question, were do you find those nba advance stats clips ? i was searching in [nba.com](https://nba.com) but couldn't find them. thanks. good oc",1,0.107,0.76,0.133,0.1879,2.83

I think we can look at his closest archetype of player historically, Magic Johnson. Magic was not the athlete Simmons is, he wasn’t going to jump over guys consistently, it was also a pretty well known fact that Magic couldn’t shoot. He was better than Simmons, but still not good. The big difference is Magic could score in a plethora of other ways. He was a good finisher (Simmons is not), he had a passable post game, which is elite for a guard (Simmons does not), and he wasn’t timid, quite the opposite. Magic wants to make the big play, Simmons does not. Honestly, if Simmons never learns to shoot, which is highly probable, but works on finishing, and develops some go to post moves, he’s a matchup nightmare. He strong, athletic, and has long arms. I think that’s a more viable route for him as a player than magically developing a jumper in one year, erasing muscle memory he’s built his whole life.

nbadiscussion,FormerKarmaKing,Bucks vs Hawks Game 3 Analysis: Predictions & Things to Watch For,2021-27-06 1:25:58 PM,"After the Bucks outmatched the Hawks in game 2 at Milwaukee, both teams are looking to make game 3 a deciding factor on how the series will play out. Here is some analysis on how tonight’s game might go in Atlanta.

The Bucks have seemed figure out how to fluster the Hawks on defense. They put pressure on Trae by eliminating his space off the PnR and helping off of the perimeter. This was a key adjustment from game 1 where Milwaukee looked to stay home and let Trae beat them off of high-percentage floater looks.

Atlanta has to get really creative on offense, and they need great production from either of their secondary scoring options (Huerter or Bogi). If Milwaukee continues to help off the perimeter (which they will), Huerter or Bogi should look to be aggressive scorers in order to make the Bucks pay.

Keep in mind, the result of Atlanta’s misses were primarily due to the Bucks defense rather than variance. To combat this, Atlanta should look to fix their spacing issues with the John Collins and Clint Capella pairing. Capella isn’t a shooter, so a Trae/JC PnR isn’t an effective game plan since Capella’s defender is gonna help in the paint. They can try to rely on the Trae/Capella PnR, but Milwaukee is going to continue to sell out and help off of JC. I expect Collins to put up a bunch of threes today.

Offensively, the Bucks still don’t have much to worry about. Maybe Atlanta can try the wall, but they have attempted this and their wall is effective with defenders Bogi and Gallo. Their perimeter defenders weren’t aggressive enough in cutting off Giannis’s driving lanes. If they are more aggressive, however, the Bucks should resort to putting Giannis in screener situations and open up scoring opportunities for Jrue/Middleton as ball handlers.

Milwaukee probably will not shoot as efficiently as they did in game 2. However, they did not sway the game from the shooting; it was the defense and Giannis being aggressive in the paint. Also, they lost by 40 points, that tells you they were outmatched on both sides of the ball.

I expect the Bucks to continue the aggressive help on Trae, which will open up opportunities for Atlanta’s wings. He should become more of a willing passer out of the PnR, and their wings will have more production offensively - the only question is if they can score at an efficient rate. Collins will attempt more three point shots since Giannis tends to help off of him.

Overall, my prediction is the Bucks win somewhere around 10-15, with another big game from Jrue and Middleton getting into a groove.

nbadiscussion,HenryGrosmont,5 biggest playoff stock risers,2021-08-07 8:33:03 AM,"Hey everyone! I’ve been writing a lot of my basketball takes recently, so hopefully u guys like this article! The 5 Biggest Stock Risers During These NBA Playoffs
The NBA is interesting because during the regular season, fans and media members overreact to players’ performances and form their “player rankings”, only for the playoffs to come around and completely dismantle the aforementioned ranking system. I say this to make the point that when we TRULY think about who the best players in the world are, we need to more heavily consider what they do in May, June and July as opposed to what they do when half of the teams are load managing. For example, take a guy like Julius Randle. He made 3rd team all-NBA (as he should have) because he had a remarkable regular season, leading a Knicks team that played their hearts out in all 72 of their games and earned a 4 seed in the competitive Eastern Conference. However, when the playoff came around and the intensity was heightened, Randle didn’t look like himself. He couldn’t overpower people in the paint anymore, he didn’t create as much space to shoot his mid-range, and he didn’t shoot the ball well from anywhere on the court. Randle is a great player, but he’s not a top 15 NBA player yet - not even close - and it’s because of what he’s done (or hasn’t done) in the most important games that an NBA player can play. Playoff games. Note: When ranking the biggest playoff stock risers, I’m considering two main components: 1) How much better the player performs in the playoffs as opposed to the regular season and 2) How much more recognition a player gets during the playoffs as opposed to during the regular season (most often a result of a certain team not playing many nationally televised games or not playing in a big market, among other reasons).
5) Kevin Huerter
Kevin Huerter’s rise is definitely a testament in part to the 2nd ranking criteria; he plays in a small market (ATL) and is an unassuming, young player who was drafted in the same draft as Trae Young (and therefore has been overshadowed in the early part of his career). However, this man can flat out BALL, and it’s been a pleasure to watch him flourish in these playoffs. First of all, he’s 6 foot 7 and a good athlete. Yes, a good athlete. He gets super high on his jump shot, and it allows him to EASILY get shots up on shorter players, both out of the post and in the pick and roll; if you didn’t get a chance to watch ATL-PHI game 7, check out Huerter’s highlights from that game in which he absolutely exposes the Sixers (specifically Seth Curry) in the mid-range. He doesn’t just have the pull-up in his bag, though, he also has an underrated handle which allows him to get to multiple different spots on the court. We’ve seen him defended by some of the best defenders in the league during these playoffs (Jrue Holiday and Ben Simmons) and still be able to handle the rock under pressure and physicality. The ability to get to spots in the mid range and rise up to hit shots consistently is something that’s sustainable to build an offensive game around (we’ve seen guys like Beal, Booker, Durant, Middleton, and MANY OTHERS do it already), and Huerter is in an excellent position to do it as well, especially considering he’s only 22 years old. Huerter has also shown a solid ability to make plays for others. He has a high level understanding of offense and is always decisive and confident in his moves and passes, allowing him to be a secondary playmaker for the Hawks during this postseason. If you diligently watched the Hawks this postseason, you’ve probably seen a few of his cross court, lefty passes off the dribble. That’s high level stuff. Finally, Huerter plays on BOTH ENDS of the court! He’s shown some incredible fight while having to defend the likes of Tobias Harris, Ben Simmons, Jrue Holiday, Khris Middleton, and many other talented offensive players. He’s just a really good athlete with long arms who plays his butt off on that end and isn’t afraid to be physical and put his body on the line. 4) Cameron Payne Cam Payne’s first claim to fame in the NBA was for his pregame dance routines with Russell Westbrook. Also, he was literally playing in China 2 years ago, and on multiple D-League teams before that, so it’s safe to say he definitely wasn’t on the average NBA fan’s radar prior to this postseason. He’s had an unbelievable turnaround, though, and he is about to get absolutely paid when he becomes a free agent next season. Payne has this special bounce in his step that I haven’t really seen before; he looks like he could be shot out of a cannon at any point and glide his way to the hoop. He’s also got a really nice floater game around the basket, and he can finish athletically with both hands and with control of his body at the rim. He pairs this with fantastic vision and a 6 foot 7 (!) wingspan, which makes him an unbelievable offensive threat. Before game 6 of the WCF (where CP3 assured all doubters that he is indeed the point God), there was a very persuasive case to be made that Cam Payne had been more effective than Chris Paul against LAC. This is because when CP3 was out of the lineup due to Covid, Payne took his game to a whole new level. We saw a confidence and comfortability that we hadn’t seen before with him, probably because he finally got the start and played big, important minutes. I had thought that maybe he would lose that bounce in his step over the course of a 48 minutes game if he was tasked with playing starting point guard minutes. Perhaps, I had thought, he was only that energetic because he comes in for 6 minute bursts. Well, I was dead wrong. Payne was as spry as he’s looked throughout these entire playoffs in games 1 and 2 of the WCF against LAC, and it has most definitely earned him a starting point guard spot in his near future, whether it be with Phoenix or another team. He’s going to get offered big money from an organization in free agency, much like Terry Rozier was offered a massive contract by the Hornets after his huge playoff performance with the Celtics in their 2018 playoff run to the conference finals. Payne has proven himself to be an impact player who deserves a firm spot in an NBA starting lineup, as well as a much larger contract than his current one (2 years, $2.1mil). The days of Cam Payne being “the guy who dances” are over, and he’s here to stay. He’ll be dancing ON the court from now on... 3) Dillon Brooks
I must admit that I’m definitely considering the play-in games in conjunction with the playoff games when ranking these players, whether that’s logical or not. But guess what? I’m writing the article, so there’s unfortunately nothing you can do about it, unless you’d like to leave me a nasty comment at the bottom of this article. If Brooks and the Grizzlies had somehow found a way to surpass the Jazz, and Brooks had continued playing the way he was, there’s a very real possibility that Brooks would have been number one on this list. The Dillon Brooks that we saw in both the play-ins and the play-offs is a two way STUD that we didn’t have the pleasure of witnessing during the regular season nearly enough due to him playing in Memphis and therefore being overshadowed by both Ja and Jonas, not to mention playing in a small market. He’s got one of the better motors I’ve seen in the NBA, and it allows him to be a pest on defense like not many others can. He guards the best player on the other team in virtually every game MEM plays, and he WANTS IT, too. He loves the competition, he loves getting in your grill and making you miserable for 94 feet, and he loves being physical. In other words, his game (specifically on the defensive end) is tailor-made to the playoffs. On the offensive end, Brooks showed unbelievable strides in his skillset during the playoffs. He’s 6 foot 7 and 225 pounds, and he’s got a surprisingly polished offensive game. Like Huerter, he has a solid handle and can get to his spots in the mid-range and just rise up, which allows him to shoot over defenders with ease. He’s a lot stronger going to the hoop than Huerter, though, and he’s got a real knack for finishing around the rim with a number of different push-type shots with both hands. Finally, he can hit the three point shot, which forces defenses to guard him on the perimeter, therefore opening up room for Brooks to attack the paint. If Brooks continues his development on the offensive end, I really think he can turn into one of the best two-way players in the NBA. He averaged 25.8 points in this postseason against a very solid Jazz defense, and there’s no question he’s already one of the toughest perimeter defenders to go up against in the league. He’s only going to continue to improve, and he’s a name that you’re going to hear in the all-star conversation next year.
2) Trae Young
If you had any gripe with Trae Young being considered a superstar before the playoffs, you can no longer have that gripe. I mean, you can, you would just be very wrong. Trae Young has a few offensive qualities that, when paired together, make him virtually impossible to stop. The first thing he has is a great shooting touch from range; you can’t leave him with a step, or else he’ll get his three off quickly and will kill you. This forces defenses to pick him up basically as soon as he walks over halfcourt (much like Curry or Lillard), and it forces them to go over screens as well. The second thing that Trae possesses is an unbelievable first step - probably the best in basketball. His change of speed and ability to burst by the defense is second to none in the NBA, and when paired with his ability to shoot, it allows him to drive with incredible ease; he had the 3rd most drives per game in the entire NBA this season, which is pretty remarkable for a scrawny guy like Trae. Trae also has the best floater game in the NBA (by far). He takes and makes the most floaters in the league, and he doesn’t really need any space or time to get it off, which makes it quite lethal. He’s also the best lob thrower in the NBA; his lob (the majority of the time to either Capela or Collins) looks exactly like his floater, too, so it makes the Hawks virtually impossible to defend once Trae gets in the painted area. When Trae throws the ball in the air, the defense is afraid to block it (because if it’s a floater, it could be called for goaltending), and that oftentimes results in an easy dunk for one of the athletic ATL front court players. When combining these three qualities (shooting touch, quick first step, and lethal floater/lob game), it makes Trae dominant offensively. It doesn’t end there, though. Trae has that killer instinct, which I think many people were surprised by; people thought that once the pressure intensified as it does during the playoffs, Trae would have a hard time dealing with it. Instead, however, Trae used the defenses’ over-aggression to his advantage, blowing by the defense and either getting fouled or getting to his floater/lob game. He talked trash to opposing players, opposing fans, and literally anyone who was willing to listen to him. Against PHI, not only did he play against one of the meanest fanbases in the league, but he was defended primarily by Ben Simmons and Matisse Thybulle, two incredibly tough and physical PLAYOFF defenders. He wasn’t phased in the slightest, and it was unbelievably fun to watch. Trae put the entire ATL team on his back throughout the entire playoffs, and he’s proven that he must be considered a top 5 NBA point guard.

It was very satisfying to watch as a fan of the game itself, and the power of a collective team instead of what in the NBA usually comes down to the power of a few superstar individuals. And of course they completed a redemption arc after losing in 2013, and it was TD's swan song, etc. So they are a beloved team. But they weren't dominant. The 2015 Warriors are a brutal matchup for them. I think that squad was as deep, if not deeper than the Spurs. People tend to forget how good they were on defense, particularly at the wing. They could adjust to anything. And of course they had a great offense that was an anomaly that no one really knew how to deal with. Even with thier beautiful game, I don't think the Spurs could keep up. Warriors in 7.",1,0.071,0.763,0.167,0.9542,3.17

Because I genuinely believe that 2014 spurs team could defend any recent dynasty besides warriors with kd, which I even think would go to a 5-6 game win to warriors. I also think they could defend even one of the later bulls teams in the 90s.

The 2014 spurs had a better bench than 2015 warriors imo and had defenders that could slow down their guards. 2015 warriors mimicked the 2014 spurs passing, but it wasnt as good as the 2014 spurs.

I think the 2014 NBA Finals against a Heat team that frankly wasn't that good has caused people to have inflated opinions on that Spurs team. In 2014, the Spurs were taken to 7 games in the first round by the 2014 Mavs, and got taken to OT in Game 6 against OKC. And system wise, I actually think the 2015 Warriors in Kerr's offense was a better version of 2014 Pop's—as it involves some triangle principles too",1,0.045,0.802,0.153,0.8932,3.03

**Ben Has Little Value.**

Ben Simmons' trade value plummeted during the course of the 2021 playoffs. The best trade package that the 76ers could possibly get in return for Ben Simmons right now is CJ McCollum and Robert Covington, and a lineup of that nature simply isn't going to get them anywhere near contending status. I pulled up a few of the trade offers that I found off B/R's ""Expert"" Trade packages: [https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2944844-br-nba-expert-trade-packages-for-philadelphia-76ers-star-ben-simmons](https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2944844-br-nba-expert-trade-packages-for-philadelphia-76ers-star-ben-simmons) You could read the article for a full analysis but I don't want to make my thread long.

*Simmons for CJ McCollum*

*Simmons for Buddy Hield, Marvin Bagley*

*Simmons for Kemba Walker*

*Simmons for D'Angelo Russel*

*Simmons to the Mavs, Kristaps to the Rockets, John Wall to the 76ers*

These are all hypothetical trades, but you can clearly see this guy isn't worth that much right now. None of the pieces you would acquire in any of these trades put the 76ers in championship contention.

**Joel Embiid Has A Lot Of Value And Is Very Injury Prone**

Embiid is coming off the best season of his career, where he just finished second in MVP voting and likely would've won the award if he played a full season. That is where the problem lies. A guy with Embiid's injury history, size, and weight is NEVER going to play a full season. I don't care what anyone says, this guy has been injured far too often and his injuries are NEVER going to get better. His value is only going to go down as the 76ers championship aspirations dwindle even farther.

With two years left on his deal, the 76ers could get an amazing trade package for him. I would assume that it would be a better deal than the one the Pelicans got for Anthony Davis since Embiid hasn't requested a trade so there isn't an impending need to trade him like there is for Ben Simmons.

If you don't believe me about the injury stuff, you can look at Anthony Davis and tell me how that worked out for the Lakers this year. And FYI, its going to be worse for Joel Embiid because hes 7'0 270lbs. Trading him right now would be the best thing for the franchise in the immediate future.

**The Big Three Doesn't Fit Together**

There is no point in trying to make Simmons, Embiid, and Harris work together. It just doesn't work.

You have to treat Simmons like a big and when you look at how the team is presently constructed, they are never going to win with two starting bigs. Simply put, Joel Embiid does not fit well at all with Ben Simmons and neither of them fit in a three way with Tobias Harris. They're all below average three point shooters in today's NBA.

Embiid: 37.7%

Tobias: 39.4%

Simmons: ... we don't have to do that to him

Though they did surround the team with role players that can shoot, it just seems like this team can't get anything done because its 3 stars are below average shooters.

**For Simmons To Be Successful, You Have To Build A Team Around Him**

Its been 4 years so the thought that Simmons is magically going to develop a jump shot is nonsense. He can get better at free throws and even if he is able to get to at least 70% (very doable if he works on just that), he can be an incredibly serviceable player. All he needs to work to get better for now is the free throw line and definitely develop a midrange game.

Knowing this, you have to surround the team with pieces that revolve around Simmons' skillset. Similar to how Milwaukee is building around Giannis Antetokounmpo, the 76ers have to build the team with Simmons' shooting woes in mind.

As for what these pieces might be, this is the part that I struggled with but thats why the Sixers hired Daryl Morey.

**Ben Simmons, The Player**

Here are a few Ben Simmons physical profile stats that would be great to keep in mind:

**Height**: 6'10

**Weight**: 250

**Wingspan**: 7'0

**Strengths**: Elite Passing Vision, Defensive Versatility, Defensive IQ, Interior Presence, Ability to guard 1-5, Elite ability to playmake and put the ball on the floor, basically everything that doesn't involve shooting

**Weaknesses**: Shooting

*His only weakness is shooting. That's something you can fix.*

You can't teach 6'10, 250lbs with the ability to put the ball on the floor the way that Simmons can. People don't understand, this guy is a physical freak of nature. Embiid is a freak of nature, but Simmons is legitimately a physical phenom. He does everything almost perfectly, except shoot the damn ball.

You can teach someone to be a decent shooter, but you can never teach someone to be 6'10 250lbs.

**Summary**

Embiid is really injury prone and likely will leave with amazing trade value so it is best to act on a trade this offseason which involves moving Joel Embiid. Simmons has terrible trade value so there really isn't a point to move him because the team won't get better. Build the team around Simmons with the assets you can get in return for Joel Embiid. A general manager like Daryl Morey won't have a problem figuring this out. One of the best basketball minds in the league. Also Tobias harris has an unmovable contract so your best bet is just to figure out how to work Simmons and Harris.

With that said, there are some holes in your argument. Embiid and Harris both shoot higher than the league average: 36.7%. The difference between Giannis and Ben is scoring though. Giannis can score at will most often, Ben cannot. Having a weakness as big as his is rough: you can't trust him on the floor right now at the end of games, he is way too much of a liability at the line. Maybe he can improve his FT% but he's a career 60% from the line in the Regular season and 52% in the Playoffs. That is an awful stat combined with not being able to score and being paid ~$36million dollars for the next 4 years. I agree that Embiid's injury history raises concerns, but I don't think the Lakers would trade a healthy AD this year for what they won last year. Simmons is too expensive to be this bad at shooting.",2,0.113,0.79,0.097,-0.4161,2.97

Joel like AD might be injury prone but they hold value cause are MVP caliber players when healthy. They are phenomenal all around talents. Ben is a gamble. If he continues do underperform he will literally be untradeable consuming massive cap space. Second, Ben won’t be a PF or C overnight. He is far from that and is undersized enough to even out his lack of skill. Giannis has freakish athleticism that allows him to change position, yet he also lacks basic post skills. Come playoff time they can’t play that position overnight, it needs time. Third, no team trades an MVP caliber player against his will that played well in playoffs. It either receives a bunch of many good players, meaning constructing a new team or swapping superstars which is practically impossible and will probably be a downgrade. Also, this team loses respect to every superstar free agent. It has never happened for a reason. That said, if Ben stays philly fans will riot.

Simply put, Joel Embiid does not fit well at all with Ben Simmons and neither of them fit in a three way with Tobias Harris. They're all below average three point shooters in today's NBA.

Embiid: 37.7%

Tobias: 39.4%

Simmons: ... we don't have to do that to him

Though they did surround the team with role players that can shoot, it just seems like this team can't get anything done because its 3 stars are below average shooters.

**For Simmons To Be Successful, You Have To Build A Team Around Him**

Its been 4 years so the thought that Simmons is magically going to develop a jump shot is nonsense. He can get better at free throws and even if he is able to get to at least 70% (very doable if he works on just that), he can be an incredibly serviceable player. All he needs to work to get better for now is the free throw line and definitely develop a midrange game.

Knowing this, you have to surround the team with pieces that revolve around Simmons' skillset. Similar to how Milwaukee is building around Giannis Antetokounmpo, the 76ers have to build the team with Simmons' shooting woes in mind.

As for what these pieces might be, this is the part that I struggled with but thats why the Sixers hired Daryl Morey.

**Ben Simmons, The Player**

Here are a few Ben Simmons physical profile stats that would be great to keep in mind:

**Height**: 6'10

**Weight**: 250

**Wingspan**: 7'0

**Strengths**: Elite Passing Vision, Defensive Versatility, Defensive IQ, Interior Presence, Ability to guard 1-5, Elite ability to playmake and put the ball on the floor, basically everything that doesn't involve shooting

**Weaknesses**: Shooting

*His only weakness is shooting. That's something you can fix.*

You can't teach 6'10, 250lbs with the ability to put the ball on the floor the way that Simmons can. People don't understand, this guy is a physical freak of nature. Embiid is a freak of nature, but Simmons is legitimately a physical phenom. He does everything almost perfectly, except shoot the damn ball.

You can teach someone to be a decent shooter, but you can never teach someone to be 6'10 250lbs.

**Summary**

Embiid is really injury prone and likely will leave with amazing trade value so it is best to act on a trade this offseason which involves moving Joel Embiid. Simmons has terrible trade value so there really isn't a point to move him because the team won't get better. Build the team around Simmons with the assets you can get in return for Joel Embiid. A general manager like Daryl Morey won't have a problem figuring this out. One of the best basketball minds in the league. Also Tobias harris has an unmovable contract so your best bet is just to figure out how to work Simmons and Harris.

*I will be referring to this later on in my analysis*.

**Ben Has Little Value.**

Ben Simmons' trade value plummeted during the course of the 2021 playoffs. The best trade package that the 76ers could possibly get in return for Ben Simmons right now is CJ McCollum and Robert Covington, and a lineup of that nature simply isn't going to get them anywhere near contending status. I pulled up a few of the trade offers that I found off B/R's ""Expert"" Trade packages: [https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2944844-br-nba-expert-trade-packages-for-philadelphia-76ers-star-ben-simmons](https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2944844-br-nba-expert-trade-packages-for-philadelphia-76ers-star-ben-simmons) You could read the article for a full analysis but I don't want to make my thread long.

*Simmons for CJ McCollum*

*Simmons for Buddy Hield, Marvin Bagley*

*Simmons for Kemba Walker*

*Simmons for D'Angelo Russel*

*Simmons to the Mavs, Kristaps to the Rockets, John Wall to the 76ers*

These are all hypothetical trades, but you can clearly see this guy isn't worth that much right now. None of the pieces you would acquire in any of these trades put the 76ers in championship contention.

**Joel Embiid Has A Lot Of Value And Is Very Injury Prone**

Embiid is coming off the best season of his career, where he just finished second in MVP voting and likely would've won the award if he played a full season. That is where the problem lies. A guy with Embiid's injury history, size, and weight is NEVER going to play a full season. I don't care what anyone says, this guy has been injured far too often and his injuries are NEVER going to get better. His value is only going to go down as the 76ers championship aspirations dwindle even farther.

With two years left on his deal, the 76ers could get an amazing trade package for him. I would assume that it would be a better deal than the one the Pelicans got for Anthony Davis since Embiid hasn't requested a trade so there isn't an impending need to trade him like there is for Ben Simmons.

If you don't believe me about the injury stuff, you can look at Anthony Davis and tell me how that worked out for the Lakers this year. And FYI, its going to be worse for Joel Embiid because hes 7'0 270lbs. Trading him right now would be the best thing for the franchise in the immediate future.

You want someone who's not a big as the superstar coming back in the deal. Options (in principle) as I see them, point is that they're implausible and/or bad: TL;DR some half interesting stuff and a bunch of memes at the end. Embiid for Lillard + more, maybe Covington and maybe even Nurkic (maybe the most plausible one to me, except the Sixers have to make up salary) Embiid for KAT and D'lo (I know I said not a big but KAT can actually shoot) (compared to the rest I'm thinking of, relatively plausible, you'll see) Embiid for Bradley Beal + more (puts Russ with Embiid, also why would the Wizards try to go with what the Sixers just failed with with an older and less defensively versatile, although not offensively incapacitated Westbrook with a much worse supporting cast?) Embiid for Bam Adebayo, Tyler Herro, and maybe more (maybe if the Tyler Herro situation deteriorates and they really want him out, but they would have better options than giving up Bam, even if it meant getting Embiid) Embiid for AD (if AD weren't handpicked by LeBron maybe possible but doesn't solve the injuries problem, and AD while a big can shoot, and AD was handpicked by LeBron so not happening) Embiid for Brandon Ingram, Josh Hart, and Lonzo Ball (Not solving the injuries problem, salaries are an issue) Embiid for Paul George and a bit more (could change a lot depending on how PG13 plays in the rest of the playoffs, also only will happen if Kawhi wants it since PG13 is there at his pleasure) Embiid for Gobert + picks (bad deal for the Sixers, doesn't solve the problems you were talking about, but at least the Jazz would take it if offered, tells you how crazy the rest of these ""options"" are gonna be) Embiid for Khris Middleton and Jrue Holiday (never going to happen, salaries are way off already and the Bucks would never do this it's just insane) Embiid and Harris for Middleton, Holiday, and Lopez (likewise insane) Embiid+a lot of salary filler they don't have for Brogdon, LeVert, and Turner (doesn't make the team better anyway) Embiid for Tatum and Brown (never going to happen because Celtics would be losing too much control and as we saw with Kemba are being conscientious of injury-proneness, and salary issues) Embiid for (sign-and-trade) DeRozan, assorted Spurs guards and maybe Keldon Johnson as a backup (no way, DeRozan isn't a 3-point shooter so it doesn't solve the problem, also might not agree to the sign-and-trade) Embiid for Julius Randle, straight up (lol jk I'm a Knicks fan and I love Julius Randle, bonus offer Embiid for Theo Pinson) Embiid for Jokic (no, I'm a Jokic hater anyway because the way I see it, he can never win a playoff series against a good offensive big because he's so terrible at defense, even if he is trying now. Against AD he would pick up 3 fouls early, sit a lot because of it until the fourth, then pick up 2 more fouls and either just not play defense or foul out. Embiid for KD, Harden, or Kyrie (no way the Nets do this) Embiid for CP3 (no way the Suns do this, also CP3 could just opt out if you do this before the season so may as well wait to see if Simmons improves his shot enough to make a difference next season) Embiid for Trae Young and more (no way the Hawks do this Embiid for all of the Mavs except Luka (then the Sixers would have Simmons and Porzingis as a ""guard"" who can't play guard and a ""forward"" who can't play forward, so it'd be funny oh yeah and btw we're not even pretending to care about salaries anymore) Embiid for whoever is on the Magic now (lol) Embiid for Christian Wood and Kevin Porter Jr (r/nba might go for it lol) Embiid for Siakam and more (doesn't make the Sixers better) Embiid for Vucevic and Lavine (probably doesn't make the Sixers better) Embiid for who on the Grizzlies? anyone? Embiid for De'Aaron Fox/Buddy Hield (let's not be mean to Joel and send him to Sacramento without one of those players, and doesn't make the Sixers better) Embiid for no one on the Warriors because their image of paying and keeping their championship core is important to them beyond short-term results, and the Sixers will not be helped by Wiggins and/or Oubre Embiid for Kevin Love and Cedi Osman (no) Embiid for Kemba (injury concerns are the reason to trade Embiid, OKC would have to throw in SGA but they're not going to do that, and Presti does not get to feed his pick fetish) Embiid to the an expansion team in Seattle (sorry Seattle fans, I'll stop getting your hopes up) Embiid to the Hornets for the entire team that won't improve the Sixers' situation",1,0.081,0.799,0.12,0.9909,2.7

Though they did surround the team with role players that can shoot, it just seems like this team can't get anything done because its 3 stars are below average shooters.

Its been 4 years so the thought that Simmons is magically going to develop a jump shot is nonsense. He can get better at free throws and even if he is able to get to at least 70% (very doable if he works on just that), he can be an incredibly serviceable player.

Here are a few Ben Simmons physical profile stats that would be great to keep in mind:

**Height**: 6'10

**Weight**: 250

**Wingspan**: 7'0

**Strengths**: Elite Passing Vision, Defensive Versatility, Defensive IQ, Interior Presence, Ability to guard 1-5, Elite ability to playmake and put the ball on the floor, basically everything that doesn't involve shooting

**Weaknesses**: Shooting

*His only weakness is shooting. That's something you can fix.*

You can't teach 6'10, 250lbs with the ability to put the ball on the floor the way that Simmons can. People don't understand, this guy is a physical freak of nature. Embiid is a freak of nature, but Simmons is legitimately a physical phenom. He does everything almost perfectly, except shoot the damn ball.

You can teach someone to be a decent shooter, but you can never teach someone to be 6'10 250lbs.

Why do you believe this? I'm not saying they should be title favorites, but this seems like a team with a legit shot of a title. Philly's a very good team *right now*; Simmons imploded offensively and they were still just a couple of possessions from the ECF. McCollum and Covington is a pretty good combo of players as long as you aren't asking them to play outside of their long-time roles. Philly is right on the cusp, and it's mostly because of Embiid. He had some struggles but, ultimately, he played like a star in that Hawks series and gave them a chance to win. You don't get rid of the guy who is the biggest reason you're a good team in the first place. >Joel Embiid Has A Lot Of Value And Is Very Injury Prone Yes on the injury prone part, but even with his knee issues he was still a beast in these playoffs. And trading a star almost never nets you a truly fair return. The Pels got a huge haul for AD, and two years later they are still an 11th seed.

Whether it’s his stubborn adjustments, the lack of preparation come playoff time, or his teams always falling short, it happens under his auspices too often. 

So question is, why was he so highly regarded out of San Antonio to get the Atlanta and Milwaukee jobs, if it turns out he’s actually not as good as people thought? How does he sell owners and GMs that he’s the best coach for the job? What’s the speciality about him? 

I realize he came to Atlanta and improved them drastically in the regular season. Same with the Bucks, but until now they hadn’t hit the ceiling (and you could argue the Nets injuries allowed it more than anything).

So you'd still have Kobe/Shaq Lakers from 05-08ish. If we're talking about a scenario where Shaq did stay fit but still fueded with Kobe and ended up getting traded to the Heat.... I honestly don't see too much of a difference given his advanced age by that time. They had a 3-2 lead on the Pistons in 05, but Wade being injured in game 6 kind of screwed them over. Maybe if Shaq was slightly more fit, and dominated the Pistons more they could've beat them to advanced to the finals? That would've been his best chance for another ring outside of his Lakers rings IMO. He'd win one in 06, that's a given. He was injured for half of the 07 season, I guess you could argue that he wouldn't have gotten injured had he been more fit. But Wade was also missing 30 games, perhaps a healthier Shaq could carry them to 50 wins in the regular season and maybe past the 1st round in the playoffs. But Wade was clearly off that year, so they probably won't make it far with Wade not at 100% Wade was injured again in 08, the Heat probably still trades Shaq since he's 35 now. He'd probably still suck with the Suns since they play a COMPLETELY different style and he's just not a good fit at 35 years old no matter how good of a shape his body is in.

nbadiscussion,Bienfuuuuu,Making sense of this Devin Booker statistic.,2021-23-06 7:54:00 AM,"All of the analysis done here is through NBA Math’s TPA Model (model explanation: https://nbamath.com/tpa-model/). This is an accumulation stat, therefore the more minutes a player logs, the higher their TPA should be.

For the last few years, I’ve been following this NBA Math TPA model because it seems to be an extremely effective indicator of player added value. For example, these are the 2021 Regular Season TPA results: https://nbamath.com/2020-21-nba-tpa/ 

You’ll find the league MVP atop this list, and also the other two finalists in the top 10 along with the usual suspects in the MVP race. You’ll also notice there aren’t really any outliers. Most of the top 20 are players that made the all-star game and make up the all-NBA teams. According to this statistic, the top 40 NBA players have a season TPA over 100. 

Great. So what’s this issue?

I think that most rational NBA fans would have Devin Booker AT LEAST in their list of top 40 players. Right? Obviously. However, on this list, he ranks 201st with a total TPA of -4.60. He is bookended by players named Cameron Oliver and Devin Cannady. The only players around him that have played remotely the same amount of minutes (2,270) are Donte DiVincenzo and Daniel Theis.

Okay so maybe he just didn’t have a great regular season? But as someone that has watched every Suns playoff game, I know he’s having a great playoffs. 

Taking a look at the playoff TPA rankings, Devin Booker is currently ranked 36th of ALL players that made the playoffs (including players eliminated after round 1). His has played 484 minutes and has a TPA of 14.33. This puts him behind 5 of his teammates, but also behind Marc Gasol, who played 87 minutes and accrued a TPA of 18.19.

Whenever what I see on the court doesn’t seem to match stats, I think the stat tends to be flawed. But this is a stat I’ve watched for multiple years now and in my opinion, is a great indicator of value. 

As someone who has loved watching the Suns this postseason, and especially Booker, how do you make sense of this statistic? Is Booker really not all that valuable? And what is the flaw/disconnect the stat has with the game?

Playoff TPA: https://nbamath.com/2021-nba-postseason-tpa/",t3_o6ef4y,https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/o6ef4y/making_sense_of_this_devin_booker_statistic/,2,8,t1_h2s3ksq,2021-23-06 8:57:32 AM,"Of course the stat is flawed. OPA is derived from OBPM. And in my view, OBPM is heavily dependent on role and usage within an offense, and efficiency. Devin Booker had a simply solid year in terms of scoring (though i think he was scorching it earlier in the season). But his assists are down. Why? Because of the addition of CP3. His OBPM is also down as a result, therefore his OPA is down. You'll find that his OBPM was better in previous seasons because he had a heavier playmaking role. Booker is much more relegated to a finishing role within the Suns offense, the recipient of set plays as opposed as the initiator. Much like Deandre Ayton, who is primarily a finisher of plays as opposed to the initiator, he also has a similar OPA and lower OBPM. Cameron Payne, who plays a heavy facilitating role within the Suns offense, has as good OPA. Now, this TPA model accounts for defense as well, and so its no secret that Booker isn't a good defender so that's going to hurt. His DBPM doesn't look too good either. If we want to look at Donovan Mitchell for comparison, he had a good regular season, but in the playoffs, his OBPM and of course TPA went through the roof because of his extremely hot 3 point shooting. So in order for Booker to have a higher TPA, he would need to take upwards of 30 shots per game, he'd need to be much more efficient from 3, and he'd have to shoulder a larger playmaking burden in the absence of CP3. None of these have anything to do with ""Oh he's not that good, or he is that good."" It's all role and usage. So then you have to ask what value does Booker add? And what would theoretically happen if he was replaced by someone else? Booker is a very good playmaker, but Cameron Payne and CP3 have those responsibilities before him. In the absence of one of those guys, Booker is able to step up into the point guard role without any issue. The value added is in his versatility, but of course, this is not captured in this stat. Let us say that Booker is off the court. As we saw in Game 2, Cameron Payne played a very good game, but at the same time, the Clippers defended Payne much better even though his numbers were much better. The Clippers sagged a little bit off of Payne and did not commit to hard doubles which didn't let Payne get as many passes to Ayton as he was doing in game 1. Payne, for the most part, did the next best thing and that was attacking the rim and into the shot blocker. This failed when Zubac wasn't on the court, but this is the desirable outcome that the Clippers want. If Booker is not on the court, even though Payne was more efficient, he would be coaxed more into shots that the Clippers want to defend as he would be the sole ball handler. Booker adds spacing and a very deadly scoring threat just by being present on the floor, and his gravity allows Payne to attack the rim with more ease. This is not captured in TPA, however. In fact, floor spacing is not even a factor at all in these advanced stats. Elite shooters such as Reddick and Korver have very pedestrian OBPM (therefore OPA), but you can not deny the fact their spacing provides immense value and impact to an offense. At the end of the day, do not doubt Booker. He is a superstar because he is both an elite scorer and fantastic playmaker. He dissects an offense in ways only superstars are meant to do. Despite the fact that his advanced stats do not look anywhere near as good as Mitchell, he has a much superior skillset, and it makes all the difference as to why the Suns have a 2-0 lead over the Clippers without needing to depend on ridiculous 3 point shooting (as opposed to the Jazz and Mavericks). When Booker is on the floor and has the ball, it's very very hard to force him into a bad possession even if he's missing more shots, when the same can not be said for Mitchell, who shot 44% from 2 against the Clippers and turned the ball over whenever he tried to make a pass to Gobert. Tldr: TPA views him as a high volume scorer on slightly above average efficiency, poor defense, and mediocre to subpar playmaking. This characterization of Booker is obviously incorrect as he is one of the absolute best scorers in the game and is a fantastic playmaker, but because TPA is derived from OBPM, Booker's reduced role with the addition of CP3 and the emergence of Cameron Payne makes his advanced numbers look a lot worse, almost akin to role players",1,0.074,0.8,0.125,0.9922,2.75
nbadiscussion,Blue_bell88,How did the 8th seeded Grizzlies beat the 1st seeded Spurs in the WCFR of the 2011 Playoffs,2021-02-07 3:41:12 AM,"This upset by the Grizzlies is something most fans have either never remembered happening, never heard of before, or just completely forgotten about it. The San Antonio Spurs were the no.1 seed in the 2010-11 season boasting a record of 61-21, good for the 2nd best record in the league. Meanwhile the Grizzlies were the 8th seed with a record of 46-26. In the First Round the Grizzlies beat the Spurs in 6 games. When i first discovered this, i was perplexed that almost no one had ever mentioned this happening before. You always hear about the ""We believe Warriors"" beating the Mavericks in 2007 yet this had never come up before. So I went to check if maybe the spurs had injuries to the Big Three and found that every player on the team played all 6 games of the series except for Manu who missed out on only 1 game, so injuries weren't the reason why this loss was excused. I have 2 questions about this.

1. To the fans who remember this happening, that either watched the games or know a bit more about this upset, how did the Grizzlies beat the Spurs?

Zach Randolph and Gasol just bullied and controlled the paint so well. Tony Allen was a really good defensive wing and the way they slowed the game down was infuriating for an opposing team trying to get any kind of rhythm going. I'd be surprised to see if any of the winning scores were above 110 and maybe even 100. Theyd run the clock to like 5 or 3 before getting up a post up shot.

nbadiscussion,TyrannosaurusGod,How did the 8th seeded Grizzlies beat the 1st seeded Spurs in the WCFR of the 2011 Playoffs,2021-02-07 3:41:12 AM,"This upset by the Grizzlies is something most fans have either never remembered happening, never heard of before, or just completely forgotten about it. The San Antonio Spurs were the no.1 seed in the 2010-11 season boasting a record of 61-21, good for the 2nd best record in the league. Meanwhile the Grizzlies were the 8th seed with a record of 46-26. In the First Round the Grizzlies beat the Spurs in 6 games. When i first discovered this, i was perplexed that almost no one had ever mentioned this happening before. You always hear about the ""We believe Warriors"" beating the Mavericks in 2007 yet this had never come up before. So I went to check if maybe the spurs had injuries to the Big Three and found that every player on the team played all 6 games of the series except for Manu who missed out on only 1 game, so injuries weren't the reason why this loss was excused. I have 2 questions about this.

1. To the fans who remember this happening, that either watched the games or know a bit more about this upset, how did the Grizzlies beat the Spurs? 
2. How did the Spurs and especially Tim Duncan/Tony Parker get away with this?

As to how it happened, the Grizzlies matched up really well, gained confidence, and had a young team with tons of energy. Spurs were aging a bit and the young pieces (George Hill, Tiago Splitter) weren’t big factor. In my opinion, the biggest issue was the Spurs were so thin at big that year, so Duncan was beaten up banging with Gasol and Randolph every game. And Randolph was a monster in the post late in games. On the perimeter, Conley and Allen were defensive stoppers able to keep Parker and Nobli from getting whatever they wanted. They played tough D all series and capitalized.",16,0.06,0.82,0.12,0.7328,2.7

\---

There was a podcast episode last year when J.J. Redick and Damian Lillard talked about how Chris Paul is one of the few guys in the league who ""try to manipulate every single play"":

https://reddit.com/link/oiw9vx/video/ryt49bj4ita71/player

And it's true. CP is a master of finding advantages - whether it be a matchup, an angle on a screen-and-roll, a foul call - whatever he can or has to do to get one, he'll probably do it.

This is most obvious when he's hunting for matchups. In this Suns-Bucks series, that's usually Brook Lopez or Bobby Portis - two guys that struggle to defend pick-and-rolls in space.

Here's a possession from Game 3 last night where Chris calls for multiple screens in attempt to get Brook involved:

https://reddit.com/link/oiw9vx/video/a633e9a9ita71/player

Brilliant play from both the Suns and the Bucks here; it's an \~18 second chess match. Let's break it down:

1. Phoenix pushes the ball up in transition and the Bucks are crossmatched. Brook is left picking up Chris Paul. Brook and Jrue Holiday quickly scram switch before the ball finds Chris.
2. Chris catches the ball with 15 seconds on the shot clock. Milwaukee is now matched up properly: Jrue on CP, Giannis on Jae Crowder, Brook on Cam Johnson.
3. Chris obviously doesn't want Jrue on him; Crowder gives him a screen to switch Giannis Antetokounmpo onto him, then sprints to the corner to get Brook's man (Johnson) to come up for another screen.
4. Jrue and Brook sniff out what Phoenix is trying to do, so they scram switch again. On Johnson's screen, Chris is immediately picked back up by Holiday. No good.
5. But now Cam clears and takes Giannis with him. That isolates Jrue and Brook on one side of the floor, and Chris immediately attacks it. He and Jae run a little pitch/slip screen/pop.
6. Jrue has to stick with Chris because they don't want Brook isolated on him, Brook has to drop at first to prevent the drive, and it allows Crowder to get open for a wide open 3. Splash.

If you're counting, that's three screens and four switches in just nine seconds. Milwaukee did about as well as they could, but Chris Paul and the Suns were simply a little bit better.

\---

Another cool moment from G3:

The Suns' ball movement on display once again...

https://reddit.com/link/oiw9vx/video/dhnht5inita71/player

On the very next possession, as the Suns were about to go swing swing swing around the perimeter again, Giannis said ""hell no"" to that and rotated to the passing lane instead of to the shooter:

There was a podcast episode last year when J.J. Redick and Damian Lillard talked about how Chris Paul is one of the few guys in the league who ""try to manipulate every single play"":

https://reddit.com/link/oiw9vx/video/ryt49bj4ita71/player

And it's true. CP is a master of finding advantages - whether it be a matchup, an angle on a screen-and-roll, a foul call - whatever he can or has to do to get one, he'll probably do it.

This is most obvious when he's hunting for matchups. In this Suns-Bucks series, that's usually Brook Lopez or Bobby Portis - two guys that struggle to defend pick-and-rolls in space.

Here's a possession from Game 3 last night where Chris calls for multiple screens in attempt to get Brook involved:

https://reddit.com/link/oiw9vx/video/a633e9a9ita71/player

Brilliant play from both the Suns and the Bucks here; it's an \~18 second chess match. Let's break it down:

1. Phoenix pushes the ball up in transition and the Bucks are crossmatched. Brook is left picking up Chris Paul. Brook and Jrue Holiday quickly scram switch before the ball finds Chris.
2. Chris catches the ball with 15 seconds on the shot clock. Milwaukee is now matched up properly: Jrue on CP, Giannis on Jae Crowder, Brook on Cam Johnson.
3. Chris obviously doesn't want Jrue on him; Crowder gives him a screen to switch Giannis Antetokounmpo onto him, then sprints to the corner to get Brook's man (Johnson) to come up for another screen.
4. Jrue and Brook sniff out what Phoenix is trying to do, so they scram switch again. On Johnson's screen, Chris is immediately picked back up by Holiday. No good.
5. But now Cam clears and takes Giannis with him. That isolates Jrue and Brook on one side of the floor, and Chris immediately attacks it. He and Jae run a little pitch/slip screen/pop.
6. Jrue has to stick with Chris because they don't want Brook isolated on him, Brook has to drop at first to prevent the drive, and it allows Crowder to get open for a wide open 3. Splash.

If you're counting, that's three screens and four switches in just nine seconds. Milwaukee did about as well as they could, but Chris Paul and the Suns were simply a little bit better.

Another cool moment from G3:

On the very next possession, as the Suns were about to go swing swing swing around the perimeter again, Giannis said ""hell no"" to that and rotated to the passing lane instead of to the shooter:

Yes Foster reffed and there was a free throw discrepancy. But as we saw in Game 1, free throw discrepancies don't tell the whole story. They won't save you if you're shitting the bed.

I'd like to hear how the reffing impacted some of the play, sure, but I doubt Foster is enough to cause a team as good as the Suns to get blown out. So what adjustments both before and during the game did Bud/Monty make that helped or hurt their teams? Were there any significant differences in who played and for how long? Which players had the biggest impact, good or bad? Can the Bucks do what they did last night consistently? 

Disclaimer: This is a question *primarily* for people who are neutral towards the Suns but if you can give a fair answer as a non-neutral fan, I'll take it. It's also for people who watched all 3 games and can break down changes in the Bucks' defensive and offensive strategies beyond 'Giannis is driving to the basket more/less'. I'm looking for ones who know their Xs and Os.

But without fans in arenas this season, did it make any difference for free throw shooters?  tl;dr: No.

I was curious about this, so I did a quick and unscientific calculation (I'm no statistician).  I got [FT% numbers for every NCAA Division I team](https://www.teamrankings.com/ncaa-basketball/stat/free-throw-pct) for the 2019-20 and 2020-21 seasons and averaged up the team FT%'s to get a proxy estimate of total FT% for each season.

&#x200B;

|Season|Average Team FT%|
|:-|:-|
|2019-20 (with fans)|70.86%|
|2020-21 (without fans)|70.92%|

Empty arenas didn't lead to any significant difference in overall FT%: only a 0.06% improvement, or 6 extra FT Made out of every 10,000 FT Attempted. For a reference point, the average team attempted about 410 free throws total last season, so this all rounds to no change in scoring. 

But what about home/away splits?  Wouldn't we expect to at least see an improvement in road teams' shooting without all those distracting fans behind the basket?

&#x200B;

|Season|Home FT%|Away FT%|Home Advantage|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|2019-20|71.58%|70.24%|\+ 1.34%|
|2020-21|71.39%|70.48%|\+ 0.91%|

Again, very slight, insignificant differences.  Teams' ""home advantage"" slipped a tiny bit, because they shot a tiny bit better on the road (+0.24%, or 2.4 extra FTs made for every 1000 attempts), but also shot a tiny bit worse at home (-0.19%, or 1.9 extra FTs missed for every 1000 attempts).

So, without the screaming, waving, distracting fans in the stands, it looks like road teams scored, on average, roughly one extra made Free Throw over the course of the entire season.  But balancing that out, teams playing without all their home fans silently holding their breath and doing things for good luck missed roughly one extra Free Throw over the season.  So it all washes out in the end.","t3_ob5jkc","https://www.reddit.com/r/CollegeBasketball/comments/ob5jkc/did_empty_arenas_affect_free_throw_percentage/",23,11,"t1_h3lns9w","2021-30-06 1:18:35 PM","My second flair doesn’t like this question",7,0,0.706,0.294,0.3612,4.9399999999999995

Hey everyone! For those of you that don't know me, I have a super attainable goal of visiting all 358 D1 arenas. I was inspired by Dan over at https://journeyto351.com/. He also posts to the subreddit at u/Operation351. As someone with a deep interest in geography, college basketball, and history, it's the perfect excuse to explore the country. I archive my arena visits over at r/AllD1BasketballArenas but also share each one here.

My first season doing this was sort of a test run. Is it something I could keep up and stay passionate about? The answer is yes! Especially after a whole season of nothing, I am pumped for this next season to start.

This ranking is something I've been putting off for a while. I've had the preliminary rankings done for a long time but kept having conflicts with my list and how I truly felt about each arena. It's hard not to have bias. I'm finally comfortable sharing this list with everyone. I encourage everyone to go see college basketball games at schools you never even thought of attending. I hope this list makes choosing which ones to attend a bit easier.

# The Rankings

---

##19 Fairfield [Fairfield](#f/fairfield) - Webster Bank Arena

What can I say about Fairfield? Well, for one, it is a great thing that they are building a new arena in place of the old Alumni Hall. The new convocation center will look phenomenal! Originally slated for a 2021 open, the new center will open now in 2022. Webster Bank is a good place don't get me wrong. I've seen concerts and Sound Tiger games there. It has hosted the East Regional for the women's tournament before. It was actually where I would have graduated if not for COVID. However, when it comes to Fairfield games, closing half the arena makes it eerily creepy.

##18 Central Connecticut [CCSU](#f/ccsu) - William H. Detrick Gymnasium

The best Blue Devils and we all know it. My brother will be starting here as a freshman next year, so it definitely won't be my last time attending. It was definitely one of the emptiest arenas I visited, and I can't blame the fans. Here's to hoping that Sellers can revitalize it. Detrick serves it's purpose. It is in the middle of campus, which is a plus, but when there is a large amount of student population that commutes, getting a sizable crowd will always be hard.

##17 Saint Peter's [St. Peter's](#f/stpeters) - Yanitelli Center

To be honest, this could probably go lower, but the fans really made the difference. Also, what other D1 arena can say they play in a building with tennis courts on the roof? Not many. Yanitelli is slated for an update in the next couple years, and it is needed. The arena is old and the location is a hassle to get to.

##16 Brown [Brown](#f/brown) - Pizzitola Sports Center

It really does pain me to but Brown so far down the list, but Pizzitola is just not a great arena. Located on the outskirts of campus, the building and arena lack the personality most arenas bring. The fan base was by far the oldest one I saw all season. That's not necessarily a bad thing, but the Princeton fans in the stands were able to be heard quite easily for an away game.

##15 Bryant [Bryant](#f/bryant) - Chace Athletic Center

Lets stay in Rhode Island for the first of two NEC schools that are pretty similar. Bryant is another school with a multi use athletic building that houses its arena. Once again, it is just a building with not a ton of personality. The fans were passionate, but that is probably the only reason I'm rating it this high. Hopefully the success of Bryant hoops will increase even more, and a new arena will happen down the line.

##14 Sacred Heart [Sacred Heart](#f/sacredheart) - William H. Pitt  Center

The Pitt Center and the Chace Center are strikingly similar. I am edging out the Pitt Center though for location. I just think the location on campus and recognition as the arena for the team was a lot more apparent than Bryant's non distinguishable building. Nothing special about the arena, but once again, the fans made up for it somewhat.

##13 New Hampshire [New Hampshire](#f/newhampshire) - Lundholm Gym

Lundholm is one of the older gyms in D1, and part of the reason it is a little higher on the list. I am a sucker for arenas with more history. The arena itself isn't anything special, but the way stories are hung up on the wall leading up to the entrance lets you know of that rich history.

##12 Quinnipiac [Quinnipiac](#f/quinnipiac) - TD Bank Sports Center

Quinnipiac has a beautiful newer arena atop a giant hill with spectacular views. That being said, Quinnipiac has two campuses, and the arena is not located where most of the students are. This will always keep down attendance figures. Props to the amazing looking arena, but an empty one at that.

##11 Fairleigh Dickinson [Fairleigh Dickinson](#f/fairleighdickinson) - Rothman Center

FDU is another arena that struggles from being located on a campus where not all the students live. However, they are able to pull in a sizable crowd of fans despite this. The area it's in is just not that nice. However, the ceiling is immaculate. Part of the reason it edges out Quinnipiac for me is I value an older arena with a more support than a new one with a small showing.

##10 Manhattan [Manhattan](#f/manhattan) - Draddy Gymnasium

Getting to Draddy is no easy feat. It sits on a hill way above the parking lot. I guess if you have bad knees they won't let you see a game. I kid, there is a shuttle system for all to use. It shares the feature of an indoor track surrounding it like FDU, which I find very interesting.

##9 Hartford [Hartford](#f/hartford) - Chase Arena

Another cool old arena. It has those gaping wooden arched ceilings like FDU which just add so much character to the arena. The layout of the seating is also very unique to other arenas. I'm glad that I was able to get to Hartford before they leave D1. My sister lives 5 minutes from campus, so I hope to see them again.

##8 Boston University [Boston University](#f/bostonuniversity) - Case Gym

Case is just a really cool location for an arena. When you think of a basketball arena, you probably think of something ground level. Boston U is not like that. The location of it on the top floor of the building gives the team an advantage. The arena is warm due to the high up location. Definitely an arena I recommend everyone see.

##7 Army [Army](#f/army) - Christl Arena

Army is a must see for any college basketball fan. Not only was it the roots of Coach K. The experience of driving into West Point is intimidating. Having military personnel check your vehicle as you drive in, seeing cadets jogging in uniform groups, and just the cleanliness of all of West Point all prove how different Army is. The arena itself is unique, with steep rows and yellow pipes running across the ceiling. The atmosphere being kind of low drops it on my list.

##6 Iona [Iona](#f/iona) - Hynes Athletic Center

Hynes is the perfect example of how modernizing an arena can improve the arena 100%. The arena was newly renovated for the 2019-2020 season. It is not that big of the arena but the video boards installed mixed with the fact it was a packed house made Iona really stand out to me. It felt like no matter where you sat, you were part of the action taking place on the court.

##5 Providence [Providence](#f/providence) - Dunkin' Donuts Center

I tried not to let the exact game I saw skew my view of Dunkin Donuts Center. I saw Providence upset a ranked Seton Hall team. The atmosphere was only second on my list to Gampel. The place rocked. A sold out crowd of 12,000 people made the building shake. My only gripes with the arena itself is the location, which is not that close to campus, a 30 minute walk away. Also, the building itself is old and not that unique.

##4 St. John's [St. John's](#f/stjohnsny) - Carnesecca Arena

Another Big East arena with a spectacular atmosphere. It is a shame that the only reason that the only reason the school doesn't play every game in Carnesecca is that it's just a bit too small. The most glaring detail is the red of everything. It is undoubtedly the arena of St. John's. The arena has some unique features. This was probably the third best arena in terms of atmosphere, and it's not surprise the Big East holds the top three spots. Even though they lost to Vermont, the fans were in full support, down to the last second.

##3 Fordham [Fordham](#f/fordham) - Rose Hill Gym

These next two arenas are arenas that are important to the history of the sport. Fordham may be the laughing stock of the A10, but the arena they play in is amazing. Exposed brick on either side of the arena tells the story of the true age of the building. Gothic architecture is just something that most don't associate with college basketball. Fordham pulls it off. Despite the schools poor history in the sports, many fans cheered them on from start to finish.

##2 Yale [Yale](#f/yale) - Payne Whitney Gymnasium

The most striking feature of Payne Whitney in my opinion is that pool smell when you walk in. It's just something that is unexpected. That being said, the arena is beautiful. A picture from the past is the best way to describe it. As a kid, I didn't understand how age showed beauty, but now I can truly take in what makes Payne Whitney so special. I wish I could say more, but it truly is something you have to experience first hand to really appreciate.

##1 UConn [Connecticut](#f/connecticut) - Gampel Pavilion

Gampel is nothing short of iconic. Located in the middle of campus, it is visibly noticeable from every direction. The circular look is something that I think really makes an arena look inviting. Even though the arena is only 30 years old, it tells a story of a school with a deep rooted basketball history, with the accomplishments of the men and womens teams being unmatched by none. The place absolutely rocks as well. I was lucky enough to attend an upset of a ranked opponent which added to the legendary atmosphere Gampel brings. Part of the reason I want to go to every arena is to see which arenas are overrated or underrated. Gampel absolutely lives up to the hype.","t3_ofjjgv","https://www.reddit.com/r/CollegeBasketball/comments/ofjjgv/i_went_to_19_different_d1_arenas_in_the_20192020/",379,115,"t1_h4etray","2021-07-07 4:08:39 PM","Interesting to see if we keep Carnesecca for smaller games, move it all to MSG, or move it all to Carnesecca.

Obviously that is an extremely crowded space, especially in a topic that so many people have interest in and dream of working in. If you went this route, I think the key is obviously producing unique content that would maybe fill an underserved niche. Maybe focusing on a conference that doesn't get a lot of coverage, unique player content, etc. If you just tried to create a site talking about the top D1 teams you'll get drowned out by much bigger and established sources. To find an audience in today's world requires finding angles that aren't already overcrowded. Also, thinking about NIL could be a good way to go since it is so new and sort of a goldrush. For instance, teaming with players on merchandise is something people will be doing, but it's new enough that it might not be too late to get involved there, though I question how big that market will end up being.",6,0.015,0.925,0.06,0.5423,3.1

Called a flagrant when there shouldn't have been one. Didn't call a technical when there should have been one.

"nbadiscussion","SaffronCityMayor","Silver Lining to Injuries: The Bull Market (Redemption?) Playoffs","2021-30-06 6:52:28 PM","We're all annoyed that we haven't gotten to see teams compete at full strength. But, we're dealt the hand we're dealt. It got me wondering about the best things that have come from this playoffs so far. And one thing that I've found striking is how many players have substantially raised their value/improved their reputation. The injuries opened up space for players to spread their wings, and it dropped expectations for most squads so that we can see what happens without lamenting what should have happened (there are a few glaring exceptions, and I'll note them). Here's a ~~quick~~ long-winded summary of some of the highlights:

* **Trae Young:** Went from a top 25ish player in people's rankings who might be a good stats on a bad team player to an unquestioned super star. His play was punctuated with a tough-as-nails, heel/ham persona.
* **Deandre Ayton:** Went from a solid young center that we hoped could make a few contributions in the playoffs to an efficient monster. There's still more to see how he sustains this play, but his ceiling was raised considerably.
* **Paul George:** There's a lot of straw manning about how the haters and fans felt, but let's be honest. Paul George was unquestionably an amazing talent who had not performed up to superstar expectations at a consistent enough level. He has absolutely been a superstar this postseason.
* **Chris Paul:** Dude hasn't had the playoff success that a pantheon point guard ought to have. He may or may not be the best player on his team, but the Suns are a team with his stamp on them, and they are clearly better for their resemblance to CP3.
* **Kevin Durant:** He definitely wanted the ring this year, and so it's a disappointment. But somehow I don't think it could've worked out better for him from a PR perspective. With Kyrie and Harden injured, KD got to put on some of the best basketball games we've ever seen anyone play. And afterward to go tell Giannis to get him one just felt right. Dude loves to hoop, and he has maybe settled into his skin enough to let that be his defining characteristic, rather than pursuing acceptance on social media.
* **Nicola Jokic**: I don't think his value changed in most people's minds, but he shored up his MVP claims by delivering in the first round and no one blames him for the Nuggets being outmatched without their number 2.
* **Seth Curry**: Seth is definitely the lowest rated player on this list so far, but his scoring for the Sixers when it was desperately needed by the Simmons void (more on that below) might have bumped him up a tier.
* **Reggie Jackson:** This guy was basically out of the league and now he's the best isolation player in basketball. Dude is unstoppable. It doesn't make sense to me, but I'm enjoying the show.
* **Role Players**: Without many of the #1 and #2 players, it's not just the new player that steps into that 'leader' spot, but the other 6th+ man who get to step up and shine as a starter. In this category, we have Terance Mann, Kevin Huerter, Boban!, Cam Payne, and others (let me know who I should be calling out here!).

Some folks have had good postseason but I feel like some negative storylines have kept their stock lower than it should be, but I still count them as net positives.

* **Giannis Antetokounmpo:** Yes, the Bucks almost lost to a depleted Nets squad and Giannis takes 45 seconds to miss a free throw. But the Shaq comparisons are becoming more and more apt: he puts up dominant numbers and can overwhelm opponents with his size and athleticism. Maybe he needs a ""Kobe/Wade"" closer to make some shots late, but Giannis absolutely can be the best player on a championship team.
* **Luka Doncic**: His stock was already high, and it would've soared even more if the Mavs closed out the Clippers. But, they didn't, his franchise is lurching around him, and both Trae and Ayton are still in the playoffs. That said, Luka's first round performance was so good, even while injured, that it feels like he took the next step in his career arc that has an all-time pantheon ceiling.
* **Dame Lillard**: That 55 point performance that had the entire NBA world watching and tweeting was a masterpiece. Moments like that is why I watch basketball. It's a disappointing season for the Blazers, and the current rumors of Dame \*maybe\* being unhappy further cloud things. On the whole, though, I'll remember Lillard's good more than the Blazers' bad this year.

It wouldn't be fair to argue that it's been a mostly positive-storyline (sans injuries) postseason without sharing what I think are the negative stories. I think these are pretty obvious, but I hope you'll see that there are really far fewer of these than positive ones:

* **Ben Simmons:** From All Star who should be a superstar to a 76ers PR project to improve his trade value. I think he'll be fine in time, but it's rough.
* **Rudy Gobert:** The one seed for Utah could've allowed Rudy to shake the reputation of being a great 'regular season' defender who can't get it done in the playoffs. I don't think he was as bad as some have said this postseason--he got put in impossible situations guarding the weak corner when the other subpar defenders on the Jazz got blown by. That said, it's hard to call this postseason a positive one for Rudy.
* **Dennis Schroder:** The Lakers mostly get a pass for losing to the Suns because of AD. Schroder was was so bad that he can't hide behind that injury.
* **Anthony Davis:** Of the injured players, AD gets the most flak. He's got a reputation for being injured too often, and this postseason doesn't instill confidence in Lakers fans going forward. His stock isn't tanking, but it's lower than it was six months ago.
* **All non-Lillard Blazers:** Dame is too good for the team to lose in the first round with a healthy roster.

Lastly, let's think about the narrative for the championship team, whoever it may be. I think at this point, regardless of who wins, it will be a redemption narrative:

* **Bucks**: Giannis takes the next step and solidifies himself as not just a great athlete but a top tier player who deserves the MVP accolades. Coach Bud also probably gets some redemption narrative going (though I personally still don't think he's been very good).
* **Suns**: CP3 and Booker are vindicated.
* **Clippers**: PG gets his flowers. Ty Lue gets a *ton* of praise.
* **Hawks:** Trae's getting ""he's a top 5 player"" buzz and Nate McMillan gets his due.

The highest expectations here are on the Bucks, and Giannis' injury even takes that off. So I think this is more of a championship for a team to win than it is one for a team to lose. That makes the positive stories even more compelling.

How would you rank these players off basketball skill, and what do these players have that sets them apart from the others? They are all very prolific scoring guards that have a deep offensive repertoire, and seem to be average/below average on the defensive side. They all are shooting guards (although Murray is technically listed at point guard) and are 3-level scorers. I’ve had the most trouble finding who is the best player of the bunch, and ranking their ability in general. They all do the same thing, and in some points they seem to be the same player.

Book, LaVine, Mitchell, Murray.  What separates them from one another? Beal: virtually no holes in his game offensively and an absolutely explosive scorer. A bad night scoring for him would be 25 points. He can hit from anywhere on the court and has become very polished offensively. Booker: probably the most dangerous scorer of the bunch, Booker is second because of how deadly he is offensively. He, like Beal, can score from anywhere and catch fire very quickly, but he struggles against certain coverages and is absolutely awful on defense (Beal is still bad but Booker is very bad). Booker is the best player on a team that’s currently playing for an NBA finals as well. Maybe in a more “normal” year that’s not true, but it’s true now. LaVine: I cannot believe how much his game has grown. He went from being just an athletic kid known for being one of the best dunkers ever, to one of the best 2 guards in the NBA. It sucks he’s on the Bulls, because he is a special player. He has become an elite shooter, finisher, and has greatly improved his playmaking. It’s been very fun to watch him grow and mature. Mitchell: I have found Mitchell to be slightly overrated as of recently. Before I get killed for this, I want to preface and say he is still a tremendous player, and one of the best 2 guards in the NBA. But these D Wade comparisons have GOT to stop. They are not only putting unnecessary pressure on Spida, I don’t think it’s a good comparison. Wade is one of the best finishers ever. Mitchell is not. Mitchell possesses long range scoring abilities that Wade never had. Mitchell is more a shooter than he is a slasher, the opposite was true for Wade. Wade could most definitely take you off the dribble and rise uo, but he was always at his best when he was getting to the rim. Wade is also a better defender than Mitchell, although Mitchell is an above average defender in his own right. Mitchell struggles with consistency. He will have games where he scores 45 on 18/27 shooting and then follow it up with a 20 point, 6/23 game. Then his size is obviously something that’s going to get mentioned, but that’s not something he can control, so it feels unfair for me to ding him for that.  Murray: the weakest out of the bunch, but still a great player. Murray plays at an all-star level for most of the year but is always going to be overshadowed by the ridiculous guard talent, especially out west. He is also an extremely streaky shooter, but when he’s dialed in, is a threat for 40+ from anywhere on the court. His playmaking is good. His defense leaves a lot to be desired. He gives Denver an entirely new dynamic on offense when he’s in, and we can see how bad Denver missed him this playoffs.",2,0.124,0.692,0.184,0.9913,3.34
 
"nbadiscussion","Bbking213","How would you utilize Ben Simmons?","2021-28-06 9:00:44 AM","Ben Simmons is what he is at this point.  Could he develop a jumpshot before it’s all said and done? Maybe, crazier things have happened but t think it’s safe to say he won’t.   With that being said, I think his full potential has yet to be unlocked, but could be given the right circumstances. 

The Embiid and Simmons pairing isn’t working in the postseason because the two aren’t a great fit.  Embiid needs a guard that can spread the floor and give him the room to work s in down low, not one that has to sit in the dunkers spot for possessions at a time because he can’t shoot. And I personally believe that Simmons needs a rim roller type big to really thrive.  Simmons is one of the best passers and drivers in the game which both bode well for the P&R, look at what Harden and Trae young have been able to do with Capela, as well as what CP3 was able to do with guys like Deandre Jordan and Blake Griffin.  Now I know Harden Young and CP3 all poses the ability to shoot the ball coming off the screen and make floaters in the lane before getting to the rim, making their P&Rs less predictable but none of them are 6’10 and and are as intimidating as a full head of steam Simmons coming at the rim. 

Too dive deeper into screens, I think Simmons is one of if not the most interesting P&R men in the league.  He has the IQ, passing ability, and handle to be an excellent ball handler, but he also has the size, speed, and finishing ability to be just as good a roller.  Simmons has never played with another high level perimeter creator that can put him in the correct positions that beat suit his skill set. Look at lamelo and Miles Bridges, bridges efficiency has sky rocketed since Melo joined, and I believe that Simmons’ athleticism is comparable to that of bridges, so if you put another quality playmaker around him I think it would unlock a Simmons we have yet to see. 

My final point is that he is not a damn point guard!!!! I don’t care what anyone says he’s not a guard, he’s a big that can handle and pass the ball and that’s how he should play. If you play Simmons more at the Center position, it creates such a mismatch for the other teams , you either force the other team to go smaller to keep up with Ben and then you use his size as an advantage, and if they keep traditional centers on him he can take them off the dribble with ease. Playing 5 out also gives your offense to flow more freely if done correctly.","t3_o9n8eh","https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/o9n8eh/how_would_you_utilize_ben_simmons/",32,33,"t1_h3jyl40","2021-30-06 5:43:05 AM","Ben Simmons is not a 1 he’s supposed to be in that same role as draymond past first big, because at the end of the day he’s a big. He should have never been put at the 1. It was only a disservice to him, he should be have the same role as the likes of bam and draymond, nowadays people are obsessed with having a big guard but you can’t be a guard if you can’t shoot. Look at Giannis he started off as a guard in a sense, ball dominated primarily by him and look how far it got them, nowhere Ben should be put at the 4 and they should utilize him in the paint more. Just because you can pass doesn’t mean your a pg, the game of basketball is and has always been about a bucket, Ben Simmons isn’t putting any of the off season work that he supposed to put in and it shows.

Philadelphia is for sure going to get a better package for simmons if they trade him after clips of him with a new shooting form arise. Or if he plays differently in games. 

I don't doubt thay philidelphia isn't gonna trade him however, I think they might wait for his value to go up so that a direct player swap would be on the table. Trading Maxey, Thybulle or Curry would likely not be something that philadelphia wants. Curry just demonstrated how well he fits with Embiid. Maxey demonstrated massive growth and I could see him being one of the best role players in the league (as good as Malcolm Brodgon). Thybulle just earned an all defensive team selection in his second year. He can be the lockdown guy that simmons is now, I doubt that philly would want to give him up with Simmons in a trade package. (I am aware that thybulle showed some serious lapses in defensive IQ in the atlanta series but that is part of being a young player).

Also, Shaq's longevity is so underrated on this site and many others.

However, where were Penny, Kobe, and Wade without Shaq in the middle? Kobe and Wade struggled to reach 0.500 without Shaq.

I get it whenever I try to argue Kareem’s case all time. People use Big O and Magic to devalue him ignoring that in thirteen seasons those guys played in their careers without him not once did they win a chip. I never hear anyone bring up 89-90 when all the elements of Showtime were intact and many in their prime except Kareem (who already was diminished from even a few years prior) had retired and they’d drafted Divac who had a solid rookie campaign. But that small change at one position took Lakers from the Finals three years in a row to losing in five in the Conference Semis. All the evidence is that Kareem was more and not less important to Showtime than most think yet many still try to argue he’s less important than many think. I think it’s the same way with Shaq. People have this habit of talking about favoring “greatest peak” over greatest career yet no one ever talks about Shaq having arguably greatest individual season to result in a championship in 99-00 when talking about “greatest peak”.

This is true even if you're talking about Steph Curry sitting on the Warriors ... and KD playing. With the rest of that team, they should have been great ... and they were merely pretty good. Not because KD couldn't lead a team with that talent to great places, but because everything they did was built around Steph's unique gravity. It's the same with Shaq. He was SO dominant during that period (if you weren't around, trust me - however dominant you think he was? He was more) that it impacted everyone on the floor. So, yeah, the teams had to completely switch what they were doing when Shaq was out, and teams struggle to make those adjustments on the fly.  The thing is, all the advantages that the Lakers have now? They had then. Superstars (both Shaq and Kobe!) forced their way there. Role players wanted to play in the city, knew they could make extra endorsement money and would have a huge national profile.  Also, part of what makes a team good is that guys are good IN THEIR ROLE. Guys like Robert Horry, Horace Grant, Rick Fox, Derrick Fisher - those guys weren't going to be all-stars, and if you asked them to carry a team they would struggle, but they were great at what the team wanted them to do. The Lakers basically had their pick of role players, and smartly didn't try to fill out the roster with stars, but rather with guys who would work well around Shaq (and to a lesser extent around Kobe).",2,0.047,0.761,0.192,0.9918,4.42
 
"nbadiscussion","BillyPotion","The Serge Ibaka trade is an underrated horrible trade","2021-30-06 9:41:43 AM","In July 2007 Phoenix was coming off a 61 win season that saw them lose in 6 games to the eventual champion Spurs when they decided to sign an aging Grant Hill to push them over the hump to a title.  With this signing they wanted to clear cap space given how cheap owner Robert Sarver was, shown through his willingness to trade the 7th overall pick in 2004 (Luol Deng) for $3 million on draft night.  Veteran Kurt Thomas and his near $8 million salary was then packaged with first round picks in 2008 and 2010 for a 2009 second round pick (which was later traded for cash) and a trade exception.  The first round picks then became Serge Ibaka and Quincy Pondexter.  Essentially the Suns traded away Ibaka for what became cash, meaning that in a span of 3 years the Suns traded away the draft picks that became Luol Deng, Rajon Rondo, and Serge Ibaka all in exchange for cash when following the trade trees to their conclusions.  There is no doubt in my mind that the Suns win the 2010 Finals if they keep these three players on the roster given that they lost to the champion Lakers in 6 games in the WCF, including a 2 point loss in a critical game 5 that saw them go down 3-2","t3_ob1564","https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/ob1564/the_serge_ibaka_trade_is_an_underrated_horrible/",210,36,"t1_h3mgl40","2021-30-06 5:05:46 PM","Sarver’s stinginess cost them so much.

For this definition, something like a Clutch Score stat should be made. It's like the Game Score, but it only accounts for Clutch plays.

●If a player makes a game winner/equalizer, that is a plus point in Clutch Score.

●If a player misses the game winner/equalizer, that is a minus point in Clutch Score.

●If a player blocks a game winner/equalizer, that is a plus point.

●If a player makes an assist for the game winner/equalizer, this is also a plus point.

There are other metrics that could still be added, but I think Clutch Score could tell us  which player we should trust for game winning situations.

Maybe, crazier things have happened but t think it’s safe to say he won’t.   With that being said, I think his full potential has yet to be unlocked, but could be given the right circumstances. 

The Embiid and Simmons pairing isn’t working in the postseason because the two aren’t a great fit.  Embiid needs a guard that can spread the floor and give him the room to work s in down low, not one that has to sit in the dunkers spot for possessions at a time because he can’t shoot. And I personally believe that Simmons needs a rim roller type big to really thrive.  Simmons is one of the best passers and drivers in the game which both bode well for the P&R, look at what Harden and Trae young have been able to do with Capela, as well as what CP3 was able to do with guys like Deandre Jordan and Blake Griffin.  Now I know Harden Young and CP3 all poses the ability to shoot the ball coming off the screen and make floaters in the lane before getting to the rim, making their P&Rs less predictable but none of them are 6’10 and and are as intimidating as a full head of steam Simmons coming at the rim. 

Too dive deeper into screens, I think Simmons is one of if not the most interesting P&R men in the league.  He has the IQ, passing ability, and handle to be an excellent ball handler, but he also has the size, speed, and finishing ability to be just as good a roller.  Simmons has never played with another high level perimeter creator that can put him in the correct positions that beat suit his skill set. Look at lamelo and Miles Bridges, bridges efficiency has sky rocketed since Melo joined, and I believe that Simmons’ athleticism is comparable to that of bridges, so if you put another quality playmaker around him I think it would unlock a Simmons we have yet to see. 

My final point is that he is not a damn point guard!!!! I don’t care what anyone says he’s not a guard, he’s a big that can handle and pass the ball and that’s how he should play. If you play Simmons more at the Center position, it creates such a mismatch for the other teams , you either force the other team to go smaller to keep up with Ben and then you use his size as an advantage, and if they keep traditional centers on him he can take them off the dribble with ease.

A lot of people say Simmons is a great passer and ball handler, but we only ever see those skills in transition offense. Nothing about his offensive game makes me think he'd thrive in a PnR. PnR is all about creating options and mismatches: Does the defensive big switch out to prevent the guard from shooting, do you play drop coverage and allow floaters, do you double, etc With Simmons there's no real need to switch or go under the screen, and he's good but not great at the rim. I think you just congest the paint like some teams do against Giannis in the playoffs and let him struggle at the rim. The best fit for Simmons imo, similar to what someone else said, is as a small ball 4 (aka hyper Draymond) where he can post up or get position and find cutters or score near the rim. Developing his jumper is a fantasy at this point, my goal would be to maybe get him a floater/short midrange game that offers some spacing and then have cutters and shooters all around",20,0.097,0.767,0.136,0.8102,3.8600000000000003

Your rim roller will have to attack 2 guys off the catch, and well, it won't even look like a pick and roll because bringing up a guy like DJ or Capela with zero range, as in zero, not even floater range, those guys score almost exclusively in the restricted area, means neither their man nor Simmons' man will even walk up to defend. The only benefit of having Simmons above the break outside on the perimeter is he can play transition defense, but we're talking offense here. What he needs is a floor spacing big, which is a premium in today's league. *Then* the pick and roll becomes a legitimate play. Well pick and pop actually. You want Simmons having the space to drive inside, and you want as much spacing as you can get around him. It's much easier to play him at the 5 though and play an oversized wing or a combo forward at the 4 for spacing. What he also needs is a legitimate dual threat guard that can score and playmake. If you're asking Simmons to be your point guard even with immaculate spacing that's not a real blueprint for success. Get a real point guard, or hell even a scoring guard with playmaking chops, and let Simmons be a point forward. Play him like Draymond on both offense and defense, though he is more of an on-ball defender than an off-ball one like Draymond. Still, he can wreck more passing lanes as a free safety with his length and athleticism. Offensively he can facilitate from the low post or forn the top of the key, or off drive and kicks, but that can't be your first option. Don't, just don't, let him bring up the ball in a halfcourt setting, outside of attacking in transition. His man won't even meet him. Use him as the screener and roll man, and his short roll passing or his finishing on the roll will be devastating with the right personnel and spacing. Watch Steph-Draymond or Wade-Lebron or Kyrie-Lebron pick and rolls. Obviously he's closer as a finisher to Lebron, but minus the jumper. You can't defend this guy with just one man in the paint, and with presumably the big defending him he will be a couple of steps ahead of the shotblocker. That will force rotations, and Simmons is a great skip passer, and he can pass to either corner with either hand. That's a play I keep stressing Milwaukee needs to run with a forward/big as gifted at passing as Giannis, the short roll is incredibly difficult to defend when you have an elite scorer as the ballhandler passing to an elite finisher and passer, who can decide to roll all the way or kick out to shooters, especially if they have the vision and skill to execute skip passes without turning the ball over. Hell run some Iverson cuts for Simmons on the right side as he is very right hand oriented as a finisher, and he will have a few steps on his defender, which leads to a layup, dunk or another open three generated. You're setting 2 screens there so have the opposing center's man screening on one of those, and Simmons either has a layup or someone is open because they need to help in the paint. If he can't turn the corner to get to the rim immediately then have him post up presumably the smaller defender on the play. Now for his ideal situation, depending on how far he develops as a decision maker, regardless of the jumpshot, either he becomes a full-fledged point forward capable of being a primary or strong secondary ball-handler, or you relieve him of that kind of role and use him as a cutter/dunker spot guy who will make plays as a short roll man and generally put him in position to make quick decisions off the catch instead of having him handle the ball for prolonged periods. In the first role you want a Brook Lopez or Myles Turner type beside him at the 5, while still having other capable ballhandlers and a go-to scorer in the lineup. If LeVert can be that scoring option then a 3-way trade between Philly and Indiana and some other team where Philly gets Brogdon, rotation players and picks, while Sabonis gets rerouted to the 3rd team. Perhaps with Charlotte where: PHI gets Brogdon, Rozier IND gets Simmons, Graham CHA gets Sabonis, Hill/Milton With picks and salary filler, perhaps some young talent or cost controlled players, going to the proper teams to even out the value. I haven't hashed out the proper value each team gets but in theory each team addresses needs while trading away some redundancies. Philly gets 2 combo guards than can playmake, score and defend, Indiana gets Simmons and a PG who can run the PnR well, and Charlotre gets their big and a guard that plays better off-ball than their former PGs, making way for Lamelo to be their full-time PG. Simmons can be the primary playmaker, or he can defer to LeVert and Graham to be the ballhandlers and he can focus on the 2nd role I mentioned, as a quick decision maker off the catch. To make things really simple though you could send him to play with an elite passing and/or shooting big that struggles defensively. Jokic for elite passing and good shooting, or KAT for elite shooting and good enough passing. Or some middle ground like Vucevic. Simmons helps prevent penetration on defense and can take literally any defensive assignment so the worse defender at the 5 can ""hide"", as well as you can hide a 5 anyway, and offensively they allow Simmons to be a cutter or make space for his drives. I dont feel like thinking up trades with Minnesota as you'll likely find plenty, but I'll think about trades that could get him to Chicago or Denver, both teams that could use extra playmaking and especially defense.",1,0.067,0.801,0.132,0.9967,2.8200000000000003
 
"nbadiscussion","addictivesign","How would you utilize Ben Simmons?","2021-28-06 9:00:44 AM","Ben Simmons is what he is at this point.  Could he develop a jumpshot before it’s all said and done? Maybe, crazier things have happened but t think it’s safe to say he won’t.   With that being said, I think his full potential has yet to be unlocked, but could be given the right circumstances. 

The Embiid and Simmons pairing isn’t working in the postseason because the two aren’t a great fit.  Embiid needs a guard that can spread the floor and give him the room to work s in down low, not one that has to sit in the dunkers spot for possessions at a time because he can’t shoot. And I personally believe that Simmons needs a rim roller type big to really thrive.  Simmons is one of the best passers and drivers in the game which both bode well for the P&R, look at what Harden and Trae young have been able to do with Capela, as well as what CP3 was able to do with guys like Deandre Jordan and Blake Griffin.  Now I know Harden Young and CP3 all poses the ability to shoot the ball coming off the screen and make floaters in the lane before getting to the rim, making their P&Rs less predictable but none of them are 6’10 and and are as intimidating as a full head of steam Simmons coming at the rim. 

Too dive deeper into screens, I think Simmons is one of if not the most interesting P&R men in the league.  He has the IQ, passing ability, and handle to be an excellent ball handler, but he also has the size, speed, and finishing ability to be just as good a roller.  Simmons has never played with another high level perimeter creator that can put him in the correct positions that beat suit his skill set. Look at lamelo and Miles Bridges, bridges efficiency has sky rocketed since Melo joined, and I believe that Simmons’ athleticism is comparable to that of bridges, so if you put another quality playmaker around him I think it would unlock a Simmons we have yet to see. 

My final point is that he is not a damn point guard!!!! I don’t care what anyone says he’s not a guard, he’s a big that can handle and pass the ball and that’s how he should play. If you play Simmons more at the Center position, it creates such a mismatch for the other teams , you either force the other team to go smaller to keep up with Ben and then you use his size as an advantage, and if they keep traditional centers on him he can take them off the dribble with ease. Playing 5 out also gives your offense to flow more freely if done correctly.","t3_o9n8eh","https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/o9n8eh/how_would_you_utilize_ben_simmons/",32,33,"t1_h3d34u5","2021-28-06 1:43:03 PM","I could see Ben Simmons working well in Minnesota.

Chris Finch has such skill integrating big men into offence. I could see Finch getting Simmons and KAT to be very complimentary of each other.

"nbadiscussion","Persianx6","How is Simmons best utilized anyway?","2021-21-06 12:16:38 PM","I saw a thread a few days or weeks ago talking about how defense is very important, but you can't be a fully defensive player with almost no offensive impact. This was in the context of Matisse making All-NBA defense, which he wholeheartedly deserved, but he's still on a very fine line of being playable on the court due to how little he contributes offensively. Same with Patrick Beverley or Frank Ntilikina.

Simmons is definitely not at that level. He \*can\* score, but he won't. He's also a much better playmaker and more versatile defender than any of the other guards I mentioned earlier.

As has constantly been the comparison, he is basically a younger, stronger, bigger prime Draymond Green, who almost anyone would say is worth a max contract or close to it...  at least when he had 3 world-class scorers alongside him. Would someone like Draymond be a max contract on other teams that didn't already have the Warriors' spacing? I'd say that's pretty debatable. Simmons is similar, where he's definitely very valuable when used the right way, but isn't someone you can throw at any team and expect them to be better.

So what's his ideal role? I don't see him as a main PG. He has solid playmaking chops, but he could focus more on getting boards, playing D, secondarily playmaking, and scoring when needed. He could be a lesser-scoring Bam Adebayo, scoring when needed and being a strong secondary playmaker and excellent person to play either help or on-ball defense on the opposing team's best player.

In an alternate ideal universe, I see Simmons playing a small-ball five on the Nets or Timberwolves, which obviously won't happen. A team with A+ spacing, and C- defense on a good day. Ben would thrive in doing the Draymond-type dirty work as a 4th/5th option on offense.

McCollum-Simmons trades have been popping up, which would definitely help the Sixers, but would clog the paint with Nurkic and Simmons similar to his situation with Embiid.

In a 3-team trade, McCollum could go to the Sixers, Marcus Smart and Tristan Thompson to the Blazers, and Ben to the Celtics. McCollum would definitely help the Sixers score and facilitate, no question there. Smart would give Dame that defensive guard who can hit a catch-and-shoot 3, Tristan can get boards and play D, and Ben Simmons could play point-center for the Celtics with Robert Williams off the bench. Only thing is after the Horford trade, Boston would end up similar to the 2020 Sixers with too many bigs on the court at once.

I don't know.

Kinda like half court playground games. take a free throw to determine who gets first possession. No winners or losers out. Each team gets 3 minutes to score however much they can.

Keep taking turns, keep adding the scores, similar to how they do it currently for the All Star Game, for each quarter scores. It might lead to impossibly large margins, like this year's All Star, but that's where the defense would really have to put their stamp on the game, to ensure the scores don't become too much for their offensive team to overcome. 

Would this allow specialists or extreme GOATs to really shine? Like, how much would Steph and co. be able to pour in the 3s on a quintet focused only on stopping him? Or, how much would a team of Ben Simmons type players cause havoc on an offense? Or would a really good Offensive / Defensive Coach be able to finally show his true value?

Players wouldn't get played off the court as they could simply focus on their primary strengths - offense or defense. We have situational subs now anyway, but in this case we'd have a longer time to be in that situation.

The San Antonio Spurs were the no.1 seed in the 2010-11 season boasting a record of 61-21, good for the 2nd best record in the league. Meanwhile the Grizzlies were the 8th seed with a record of 46-26. In the First Round the Grizzlies beat the Spurs in 6 games. When i first discovered this, i was perplexed that almost no one had ever mentioned this happening before. You always hear about the ""We believe Warriors"" beating the Mavericks in 2007 yet this had never come up before. So I went to check if maybe the spurs had injuries to the Big Three and found that every player on the team played all 6 games of the series except for Manu who missed out on only 1 game, so injuries weren't the reason why this loss was excused. I have 2 questions about this.

They are the spurs. They are lowkey, never a media darling and they go out and play. As for why it wasn't held against them, well they did win 3 of the previous 7 titles before that. So you can kinda understand why people don't hold it against them. Its not like that was prime Tim Duncan in 2011.

I don’t think that anyone predicted an upset but it wasn’t nearly as shocking as DAL-GSW (IIRC GSW got into the playoffs the last day of the season and were considered roadkill for DAL). Also DAL had Dirk on his MVP and this was the year after they lost in the Finals. It’s always worse to the first team it happens to, plus the NBA media loved the Pop/Duncan Spurs. SEA had the stink of losing to DEN in the first round for a while too, until they made a Finals run in ‘96. Also that GSW team was much more memorable for the crowd and the way they played which was a precursor to the modern style of PnR and a lot of threes and dunks. Also the Spurs won a title a few years later against the Heatles after losing the year before which is a more memorable event. Plus Duncan and crew won four titles total so it’s easier to lose that stigma",4,0.143,0.758,0.099,-0.8415,2.49

I get the unwillingness to shoot is frustrating to people, but some people are acting like he is just a bum with no great qualities.

"nba","GalaxyMiPelotas","Has a player ever embodied his team’s name more than Giannis embodies a buck?","2021-11-07 5:09:06 PM","When Milwaukee was awarded an NBA team in 1968 the city held a fan contest to name the new team. The name ""Bucks"" was chosen because “bucks are spirited, good jumpers, fast and agile”. Almost 45 years later Giannis enters the league doing his best impression of a buck – he’s definitely spirited, he can jump out the gym, and doing so all while being fast and agile.

So has a player eclipsed Giannis as the perfect embodiment of his team’s name? Let’s find out.

\*Disclaimer – some teams’ names are too abstract or “wild” to embody (how does one embody a thunder? And what the \*\*\*\* is a clipper?) so I had to bend the rules a little bit. Also, as a so-called “nephew”, I tried to choose only players who played in the last 30ish years.

&#x200B;

|Atlanta Hawks|The Human Highlight Reel, Jacques Dominique Wilkins|
|:-|:-|
|Boston Celtics|Every player whom Bill Russell carried to multiple championships|
|Brooklyn Nets|KD due to his thin and lanky frame, idk it’s a net…|
|Charlotte “New Orleans Hornets” Hornets|CP3 due to his short stature and his sometimes-annoying antics|
|Chicago Bulls|Dennis Rodman (just change the red cloth to an orange ball)|
|Cleveland Cavaliers|Any player on the 2007 Cavs that Lebron carried to the finals (fittingly, the word Cavalier was originally used to describe supporters of King Charles in the English Civil War, who also lost in a sweeping fashion)|
|Dallas Mavericks|The original euro unicorn himself, Dirk Nowitzki, with his unorthodox patented one-legged fadeaway|
|Denver Nuggets|The Nuggets struck gold picking the reigning MVP Nikola Jokic with the 41st pick|
|Detroit Pistons|Ben Wallace with his unrelenting motor|
|Golden State Warriors|Draymond “heart of a warrior” Green|
|Houston Rockets|Kenny “The Jet” Smith who often tries to achieve great heights but mostly end up imploding|
|Indiana Pacers|Darren Collison who cleared a Shuttle Run in 3.1 seconds in the draft combine|
|Los Angeles Clippers|Patrick Beverly, captain of the Cancun cruise ship|
|Los Angeles Lakers|Let me know if you find someone who can be described as “lakey”|
|Memphis Grizzlies|Zach Randolph and Marc Gasol share the title for the most grizzly bear-esque figure|
|Miami Heat|Mario Chalmers cause his name always reminds me of Charmander which is a fire type Pokémon and cause I couldn’t figure who else to pick|
|Minnesota Timberwolves|Jimmy Butler due to his “Dog Mentality” (after all, what is a timber wolf if not a glorified feral dog?)|
|New Orleans Pelicans|Zion Williamson, due to his ability to, hmm, eat|
|New York Knicks|Yeah I’m not even gonna try this one|
|Oklahoma City Thunder|Russell Westbrook on account of his thunderous dunks and shouts|
|Orlando Magic|Scott Skiles who magically made 30 assists in a game while playing in Orlando|
|Philadelphia 76ers|Joel Embiid who looked 76 since his rookie year|
|Phoenix ""Suns in 4"" Suns|Kelly Oubre Jr. due to the sun’s “hotness” factor|
|Portland Trail Blazers|Damian Lillard who pioneered the deep three|
|Sacramento Kings|Reginald “Reggie” King (aka “King King”) for obvious reasons|
|San Antonio Spurs|Bruce Bowen on account of Steve Nash’s face|
|Toronto Raptors|Chris “Velociraptor” Bosh, [do I need to say more](https://imgur.com/gallery/FUKOeTs)?|
|Utah Jazz|Pistole Pete for his smooth style of play|

On his previous contract (4/98!), he was one of the most maligned bigs in the league, for good reason. His gaudy numbers got him paid, but his impact on the game was usually negative due to attitude and defensive problems. The market caught up to him this past year, however, and he’s now making the minimum as a 3rd string center on a bad team. 

He’ll be a UFA this upcoming season. If it were your team, would you want to take a swing on his proven blocking and rebounding numbers off the bench? Or are his shortcoming enough that you wouldn’t want him at all, even in a much cheaper contract and a smaller role.

He's literally unstoppable and unguardable on his drives and paint game. Does it matter whether he uses a slick jumpshot like KD or whether he just stuffs everyone's face and dunks on em? Not in my book. Now, the nephews are saying that he has a weakness in his game and that's why he had low play-off success,  but let me ask you this: what happens if you swap any of the higher ranked players with Giannis in the previous bucks teams? Do these players shine while getting doubled and finding the wall on every single possession? Do they win that much more with those bucks squads, their playstyle (the ""random"" schemes etc.. ) and the bucks players performances?  Can KD score on 2019 Kawhi lock down defense and help from Ibaka? Can he do it THAT much more than Giannis did it, so as to be a definite higher ranked player? I personally don't think so. KD has rarely had to succeed in a team where he could be easily doubled on by the defense. Kawhi was getting doubled on the spurs and didn't win anything. Lebron invented the superteams just to overcome this exact problem and he maybe won alone once, in his absolute prime. Giannis is as dominant as any of these guys, and he's not even done improving yet. He's definitely higher than top 5, and soon we will be comparing his accomplishments to lebrons and the rest of the goats.","t3_oip2yx","https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/oip2yx/consensus_top_5_and_why_giannis_is_top_1/",0,35,"t1_h4wrf59","2021-12-07 4:38:30 AM","Even if giannis wins the title, he wont be the best player in the nba because his game has too many deficiencies.

Here is the positional breakdown of NBA scoring champs:

The only buzzer beater which counted in the 2016 playoffs is Lowry's half-court heave to send Game 1 to Overtime in one of the best 2nd round series in NBA history against the Heat.","t3_oi9fep","https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/oi9fep/there_are_currently_0_game_winning_buzzer_beaters/",924,100,"t1_h4ugaom","2021-11-07 1:42:27 PM","I’ve never heard anyone talk about he  best 2nd round matches in history lol Also there has to be many 2nd rd  series better than that",13,0,0.699,0.301,0.872,4.51

If the Bucks can get Ayton into foul trouble, it's an even greater advantage if the Suns bring in Kaminsky off the bench. He's weak on the boards, not as agile or strong defensively, and not much of a threat offensively. He isn't playing aggressively and sort of stands around. He'll need to bring some intensity the rest of the series of he continues to get minutes.

"nba","RF_Sunter","Consistency and Efficiency, a study of the top 20 scorers in the NBA this year","2021-11-07 2:32:46 PM","# **Preface**
If you're a stat-head like me, you likely spend a lot of time looking at every chart for a given player on Basketball Reference (or insert your stat site of choice).  There is a lot of powerful information in available metrics (especially adjusted shooting), but the one area where stats seem a bit deficient, is **quantifying ""consistency"" and ""efficiency""**.  
 
&nbsp;

Player ""X"" may average 25ppg on 55% Fg and 40% 3Pt, but that doesn't tell you anything about the spread of data.  Basically, it's difficult to look at a cumulative stat sheet for a player, and derive how often that 25ppg/55% Fg/40% 3Pt player shows up each night.  The lack of a consistency metric leads to a lot of speculative opinions about players; ""Player 'X' is good, but he's streaky and has a lot of hot and cold nights.""  Without watching every single game for Player ""X"", or looking at the entire gamelog for a season, it's difficult to have a response to said speculation, without you speculating as well, leading to *an ouroboros of speculation*.  
  
&nbsp;

This morning, I sat down, and went through the entire season of gamelogs for each of the top 20 scorers in the NBA, to provide both myself, as well as you all, with a little bit of clarity on how consistent, and efficient each of those players are.  

&nbsp;

# **Understandings (please read this)**  
There are two very important understandings that must be had, when looking at this data.  They are:

 * Nightly Average Shooting %
 * Standard Deviation (or StDev)

&nbsp;

## **Nightly Average Shooting %**

While this is the ""less complicated"" of the two, I am covering this one first, because I know this one will cause the most confusion.  

&nbsp;

The shooting percentages you see on a stat sheet, are an *average of cumulative metrics*.  The shooting percentages you will see in my tables, do not take this into consideration, because an average of all shots for an entire season doesn't tell you anything about consistency.

&nbsp;

 **Example**
For this example, lets take an imaginary 7 game series (to make this as simple as possible).  In this scenario, lets say Steph Curry had 3Pt shooting nights of:

* 10/10  
* 10/10  
* 0/5  
* 0/2  
* 0/3  
* 0/4  
* 0/5 

&nbsp;

Steph's 3pt shooting percentage of this series would be 20/39, or 51.28%.  If you just looked at that 51.28%, you would think ""*How did the Warriors lose?  Steph shot over 50% from 3!*""  The actual truth would be that **for over half the series, Steph shot very poorly**, he had 2 great games, and 5 bad games.  His **Nightly Average 3pt%** would be 28.57% ( much lower than his series 3Pt% of 51.28%). 

&nbsp; 

## **Standard Deviation (StDev)**  
  
This one is going to be a bit rough, and I'm going to keep it as simple as possible.  Professional data scientists, actual statisticians, and people that are REALLY deep into ""*stonks*"" will know what this is without having to read this section.  
  
&nbsp;

Here is a very layman's explanation of StDev and what you need to know:  
  
 1. StDev is the measurement of volatility of a data set.  Basically, how spread the data is.  
 2. **LOWER IS ALWAYS BETTER when consistency is a concern**  
 3. It's a bit more complicated than this, and without boring you with a lot of math, if you're curious on how StDev works, there are some great YouTube videos that describe it in a very digestible/visual way.  There is no shame in watching them, because even I had to do it, 5 years ago, when I first started using StDev as a method to evaluate data in my primary hobby, astrophotography.  
&nbsp;

## **The Actual Data!**  

*Note 1: This data is sorted by actual PPG, I will have breakdowns of each section below the table*  
*Note 2: Bold means ""leader among the Top 20""*  
*Note 3: Italics means ""worst among the Top 20""*

I guess all of the ""robotic"" jokes about Kawhi Leonard have some statistical basis.  **Out of all of the top 20 scorers, Kawhi had the greatest chance of bringing every point of that 24.8 PPG to the table each game.**  His season high was 36 points, and his low was 13 points.

&nbsp;

Curry, well, when you carry a team that hard, I guess there will be a lot of fluctuation in your points output.  **His season average was 31.98 (basically 32), and he had 29 games of sub-average performance, and three games where he didn't even score half of his season average.**  His season high was 62 points (18 ft, 8 threes, and 18 buckets overall), and his season low was 11 (2 of 16 shooting for that game).

I doubt there is much surprise about the top, or the bottom of this list.  Zion is a dunk machine, almost 70% of his shots take place 0-3 feet from the basket, and nobody is going to stop his 284 lbs of fury.  **Ben Simmons, passing out of a wide open dunk, needs to watch some Zion footage.**

&nbsp;

The bottom of this list features two heavy volume shooters in Donovan Mitchell and Trae Young.  While 44% nightly field goal percentage isn't ""bad"", it's not great.  If you look at a lot of Hawks and/or Jazz box scores, you probably already had an inkling that neither of these two folks have an overwhelming amount of efficient nights.  **Mitchell had 10 nights this season where he shot worse than 35%, and Trae said ""*hold my beer*"" with 17 of his own nights (this is over 1/4th of his entire games played this season).**  Mitchell and Young are, at the very minimum, average in their TS+ (Trae being 103 and Mitchell being exactly league average at 100, though his actual TS is below league average .569 to .572), but both definitely struggle with consistent efficiency.

&nbsp;

The top two, and bottom two, tell interesting stories.  Being ""consistent"" isn't always good, but it's also not always bad, it's all about context.  If you're a 25% shooter, you WANT your consistency to be way off, because you don't want to show up, every single night, and give 25% to your team.  **Luka leads the pack here, but it's not as good as Kawhi's efficiency, because Luka is extremely consistent at being averagely efficient (when compared to the top 20 here, as his average nightly Fg% is in the bottom half of this pack).**  Kawhi is in the top 5 for average nightly Fg%, as well as being 2nd on the list of standard deviation among his Fg% data.

&nbsp;

The bottom two, well ""*The Lord giveth, and the Lord taketh away*"".  Zion is, by far, the most efficient on a night by night basis, but due to the fact that his nightly Fg% is so absurdly high, he's going to have a decent amount of games where his Fg% is in the range of mere mortals.  **Zion had an impressive 10 games this season where he shot over 75%, but he also had 31 games this season where he shot below his nightly Fg% (though only 3 games where he was below 45%!).** 

&nbsp;

The Jaylen Brown stats are not that bad, hold those downvotes Celtics fans.  Yes, he's wildly inconsistent when compared to everyone else in this top 20, BUT, he's inconsistent on the good side.  He's 8th in his nightly Fg%, .490, pretty good.  **He had 29 games this season (over half his entire season) where he shot above that mark of .490, including an 85% night (17/20 shooting).**. Yeah, he's a bit erratic, but over half the time when he steps on the court, you're getting the ""*good*"" type of erratic; The type of erratic that John Starks fans loved.

&nbsp;

Ok, so yeah... This data set features the least practicable thing I thought I would see today, and the most predictable thing I would see today.  **When I started off this morning (7 hours ago from the moment I am typing this), I did NOT expect to see that Joel Embiid was going to be the most efficient 3Pt shooter out of the entire top 20 scorers in the league (on a night by night basis).** I will explain how this works in the next breakdown, where I talk about 3Pt% StDev.  Worry not Warriors fans, Steph is still the premiere ""*God Tier*"" 3Pt shooter in the league.

&nbsp;

*Exhales...* Let me begin this by saying that I'm a 30+ year Suns fan.  I pre-date the Barkley trade, and have been with them through all of the good, and all of the bad.  When I was stationed in Europe, I would stay up at crazy hours, just so I could root for the Purple and Orange.  I went to games at the Madhouse on McDowell.  With that out of the way: Devin Booker is a very inefficient 3Pt shooter.  As you've seen in the last game (assuming I get this out before this evening's game), he's not a ""*bad*"" 3Pt shooter (he hit a few HUGE threes), but he is rather inefficient on a night-to-night basis.  You don't even have to watch Suns games to understand this either, you can look at the box scores.  **The league average (this season) was .367 from 3, wanna guess how many games Devin spent below the league average?**  39 games (58% of the games he played this season), including 10 games where he was 0% from 3.  

## **3Pt% (StDev)**

 1. Lillard	0.151 
 2. Curry	0.158 
 3. Tatum	0.180 
 4. Doncic	0.188 
 5. LaVine	0.193 
 6. Fox	0.196 
 7. Brown	0.196 
 8. Ingram	0.200 
 9. Mitchell	0.201 
 10. Booker	0.207 
 11. Beal	0.219 
 12. Young	0.221 
 13. Irving	0.223 
 14. Leonard	0.257 
 15. Randle	0.258 
 16. Antetokounmpo	0.259 
 17. Sexton	0.273 
 18. Jokic	0.305 
 19. Embiid	0.337 
 20. Williamson	0.450

&nbsp;

Lets address the open item from the breakdown before this one.  **Embiid is not an elite 3Pt shooter, he just doesn't shoot a lot (for a 3Pt shooter) and he has a decent number (8 to be exact) of 100% nights (where he went 1/1 or 2/2).**   Yes, Book has 10 nights of 0%, but Embiid has 12 nights of the same percentage.  Roughly 24% of the time Joel steps onto the court, he's going to be a complete dud from 3.

&nbsp;

**Steph is still the gold standard when it comes to 3Pt shooting.**  Lillard is on top of this list, meaning that he's the most consistent, but all that means is that he's the most consistent at bringing home a nightly 3Pt% lower than Steph (8% lower, relatively).  Props to Dame, but Curry is the King, all Hail to the Chef.

## **Nightly Ft% (Average)**

 1. Irving	0.923 
 2. Curry	0.914 
 3. Lillard	0.906 
 4. Young	0.891 
 5. Leonard	0.885 
 6. Beal	0.883 
 7. Booker	0.865 
 8. Tatum	0.864 
 9. Ingram	0.860 
 10. LaVine	0.859 
 11. Jokic	0.857 
 12. Embiid	0.849 
 13. Mitchell	0.827 
 14. Sexton	0.816 
 15. Randle	0.803 
 16. Brown	0.770 
 17. Doncic	0.728 
 18. Williamson	0.707 
 19. Fox	0.705 
 20. Antetokounmpo	0.683

&nbsp;

Well, it was nice knowing you.  This is likely where everyone checks out, if you haven't checked out already (lets be real, this is a wall of text after all).  Not many folks are going to care about Ft%, except for the diehard stat-heads.

&nbsp;

**Kyrie had a 50/40/90 season (and 36 perfect games), Steph is on the same level as Steve Nash when it comes to free throws (he had 36 as well), and Dame is an elite-level free throw shooter as well (38 perfect games for Dolla).**  Not many surprises here.

&nbsp;

**And coming in at the bottom, the Balkan Brick himself, Giannis.**  To be honest though, it's not nearly as bad as I thought it would be, and he only had 1 game of 0% all year

## **FT% (StDev)**

 1. Young	0.116 
 2. Beal	0.131 
 3. Curry	0.134 
 4. Booker	0.152 
 5. Irving	0.154 
 6. Lillard	0.162 
 7. Williamson	0.162 
 8. Embiid	0.163 
 9. Leonard	0.167 
 10. Fox	0.179 
 11. Sexton	0.179 
 12. Randle	0.183 
 13. Tatum	0.190 
 14. Mitchell	0.193 
 15. Jokic	0.195 
 16. Antetokounmpo	0.195 
 17. LaVine	0.201 
 18. Doncic	0.209 
 19. Ingram	0.217 
 20. Brown	0.260

&nbsp;

I'm on the home stretch.  I'm going to make a PB&J sandwich after this, and it's going to be awesome.

&nbsp;

**The reason why I love Trae Young is specifically this.  Yes, he's pretty inefficient, but the man makes up for it at the line.**  He is an elite Ft shooter, and he's massively consistent at being elite.  His consistency at the line is unparalleled, only having one game of below .667 this entire season (Steph had 4, Dame had 3, Kyrie had 2).  

&nbsp;

**Celtics fans, I don't hate your team, Jaylen Brown is just a weird guy.**  His consistency at the line isn't great, but he also hardly gets there on a night to night basis.  Jaylen had nine games this year where he didn't even get to the line at all.  He had two 0% games, which is double what Giannis, but he also had 20 perfect games.  He plays nothing like John Starks, but his consistency is very reminiscent of him.

## **Conclusions**
**If you take anything away from reading this, please understand that EVERYTHING in basketball is relational.** Someone's PPG doesn't matter, if you don't know the percentages behind it.  Someone's ORTG or DRTG means nothing if you don't know specific components of their game behind said rating (case in point, Robin Lopez once led the league in ORTG, look it up, 2013-2014 season).
&nbsp;


**Being consistent is neither good nor bad, without knowing someone's efficiency to begin with.**  Being consistently inefficient is bad, and being inconsistently good is also bad.  They are two wildly different metrics, but they also need each other in order to having any meaning at all.

&nbsp;

I hope you enjoyed my Ted Talk.  Thank you for reading this.

If you're a stat-head like me, you likely spend a lot of time looking at every chart for a given player on Basketball Reference (or insert your stat site of choice).  There is a lot of powerful information in available metrics (especially adjusted shooting), but the one area where stats seem a bit deficient, is **quantifying ""consistency"" and ""efficiency""**.  
 
&nbsp;

Player ""X"" may average 25ppg on 55% Fg and 40% 3Pt, but that doesn't tell you anything about the spread of data.  Basically, it's difficult to look at a cumulative stat sheet for a player, and derive how often that 25ppg/55% Fg/40% 3Pt player shows up each night.  The lack of a consistency metric leads to a lot of speculative opinions about players; ""Player 'X' is good, but he's streaky and has a lot of hot and cold nights.""  Without watching every single game for Player ""X"", or looking at the entire gamelog for a season, it's difficult to have a response to said speculation, without you speculating as well, leading to *an ouroboros of speculation*.  
  
&nbsp;

This morning, I sat down, and went through the entire season of gamelogs for each of the top 20 scorers in the NBA, to provide both myself, as well as you all, with a little bit of clarity on how consistent, and efficient each of those players are.  

&nbsp;

# **Understandings (please read this)**  
There are two very important understandings that must be had, when looking at this data.  They are:

 * Nightly Average Shooting %
 * Standard Deviation (or StDev)

&nbsp;

## **Nightly Average Shooting %**

While this is the ""less complicated"" of the two, I am covering this one first, because I know this one will cause the most confusion.  

&nbsp;

The shooting percentages you see on a stat sheet, are an *average of cumulative metrics*.  The shooting percentages you will see in my tables, do not take this into consideration, because an average of all shots for an entire season doesn't tell you anything about consistency.

&nbsp;

 **Example**
For this example, lets take an imaginary 7 game series (to make this as simple as possible).  In this scenario, lets say Steph Curry had 3Pt shooting nights of:

* 10/10  
* 10/10  
* 0/5  
* 0/2  
* 0/3  
* 0/4  
* 0/5 

&nbsp;

Steph's 3pt shooting percentage of this series would be 20/39, or 51.28%.  If you just looked at that 51.28%, you would think ""*How did the Warriors lose?  Steph shot over 50% from 3!*""  The actual truth would be that **for over half the series, Steph shot very poorly**, he had 2 great games, and 5 bad games.  His **Nightly Average 3pt%** would be 28.57% ( much lower than his series 3Pt% of 51.28%). 

&nbsp; 

## **Standard Deviation (StDev)**  
  
This one is going to be a bit rough, and I'm going to keep it as simple as possible.  Professional data scientists, actual statisticians, and people that are REALLY deep into ""*stonks*"" will know what this is without having to read this section.  
  
&nbsp;

Here is a very layman's explanation of StDev and what you need to know:  
  
 1. StDev is the measurement of volatility of a data set.  Basically, how spread the data is.  
 2. **LOWER IS ALWAYS BETTER when consistency is a concern**  
 3. It's a bit more complicated than this, and without boring you with a lot of math, if you're curious on how StDev works, there are some great YouTube videos that describe it in a very digestible/visual way.  There is no shame in watching them, because even I had to do it, 5 years ago, when I first started using StDev as a method to evaluate data in my primary hobby, astrophotography.  
&nbsp;

## **The Actual Data!**  

*Note 1: This data is sorted by actual PPG, I will have breakdowns of each section below the table*  
*Note 2: Bold means ""leader among the Top 20""*  
*Note 3: Italics means ""worst among the Top 20""*

This list doesn't need a lot of analysis, you can get this list directly from Basketball Reference.  You don't/shouldn't need anyone to break down PPG for you.  If PPG were a TV show, it would be ""The Office"", because everyone can understand it, and everyone quotes it.
  

## **Points Per Game (StDev)**

 1. Leonard	5.91 
 2. Ingram	5.98 
 3. Williamson	6.29 
 4. Sexton	6.32 
 5. Brown	7.05

 18. Tatum	9.39 
 19. Embiid	9.79 
 20. Curry	10.38

&nbsp;

I guess all of the ""robotic"" jokes about Kawhi Leonard have some statistical basis.  **Out of all of the top 20 scorers, Kawhi had the greatest chance of bringing every point of that 24.8 PPG to the table each game.**  His season high was 36 points, and his low was 13 points.

&nbsp;

Curry, well, when you carry a team that hard, I guess there will be a lot of fluctuation in your points output.  **His season average was 31.98 (basically 32), and he had 29 games of sub-average performance, and three games where he didn't even score half of his season average.**  His season high was 62 points (18 ft, 8 threes, and 18 buckets overall), and his season low was 11 (2 of 16 shooting for that game). 

## **Nightly Fg% (Average)**

 1. Williamson	0.621 
 2. Jokic	0.576 
 3. Antetokounmpo	0.574 
 4. Leonard	0.521 
 5. Embiid	0.508 
 6. Irving	0.506 
 7. LaVine	0.501 
 8. Brown	0.490 
 9. Beal	0.483 
 10. Curry	0.481 
 11. Booker	0.481 
 12. Doncic	0.475 
 13. Fox	0.474 
 14. Sexton	0.472 
 15. Ingram	0.470 
 16. Tatum	0.455 
 17. Randle	0.452 
 18. Lillard	0.449 
 19. Mitchell	0.443 
 20. Young	0.432

&nbsp;

I doubt there is much surprise about the top, or the bottom of this list.  Zion is a dunk machine, almost 70% of his shots take place 0-3 feet from the basket, and nobody is going to stop his 284 lbs of fury.  **Ben Simmons, passing out of a wide open dunk, needs to watch some Zion footage.**

&nbsp;

The bottom of this list features two heavy volume shooters in Donovan Mitchell and Trae Young.  While 44% nightly field goal percentage isn't ""bad"", it's not great.  If you look at a lot of Hawks and/or Jazz box scores, you probably already had an inkling that neither of these two folks have an overwhelming amount of efficient nights.  **Mitchell had 10 nights this season where he shot worse than 35%, and Trae said ""*hold my beer*"" with 17 of his own nights (this is over 1/4th of his entire games played this season).**  Mitchell and Young are, at the very minimum, average in their TS+ (Trae being 103 and Mitchell being exactly league average at 100, though his actual TS is below league average .569 to .572), but both definitely struggle with consistent efficiency.

## **FG% (StDev)**

 1. Doncic	0.090 
 2. Leonard	0.098 
 3. Booker	0.101 
 4. Sexton	0.106 
 5. Beal	0.109 
 6. Lillard	0.109 
 7. Fox	0.109 
 8. Curry	0.110 
 9. Randle	0.112 
 10. Jokic	0.113 
 11. Mitchell	0.114 
 12. Ingram	0.115 
 13. Antetokounmpo	0.115 
 14. Irving	0.117 
 15. Tatum	0.120 
 16. LaVine	0.126 
 17. Young	0.130 
 18. Embiid	0.131 
 19. Williamson	0.133 
 20. Brown	0.134

&nbsp;

The top two, and bottom two, tell interesting stories.  Being ""consistent"" isn't always good, but it's also not always bad, it's all about context.  If you're a 25% shooter, you WANT your consistency to be way off, because you don't want to show up, every single night, and give 25% to your team.  **Luka leads the pack here, but it's not as good as Kawhi's efficiency, because Luka is extremely consistent at being averagely efficient (when compared to the top 20 here, as his average nightly Fg% is in the bottom half of this pack).**  Kawhi is in the top 5 for average nightly Fg%, as well as being 2nd on the list of standard deviation among his Fg% data.

&nbsp;

The bottom two, well ""*The Lord giveth, and the Lord taketh away*"".  Zion is, by far, the most efficient on a night by night basis, but due to the fact that his nightly Fg% is so absurdly high, he's going to have a decent amount of games where his Fg% is in the range of mere mortals.  **Zion had an impressive 10 games this season where he shot over 75%, but he also had 31 games this season where he shot below his nightly Fg% (though only 3 games where he was below 45%!).** 

&nbsp;

The Jaylen Brown stats are not that bad, hold those downvotes Celtics fans.  Yes, he's wildly inconsistent when compared to everyone else in this top 20, BUT, he's inconsistent on the good side.  He's 8th in his nightly Fg%, .490, pretty good.  **He had 29 games this season (over half his entire season) where he shot above that mark of .490, including an 85% night (17/20 shooting).**. Yeah, he's a bit erratic, but over half the time when he steps on the court, you're getting the ""*good*"" type of erratic; The type of erratic that John Starks fans loved.

## **Nightly 3pt% (Average)**

 1. Embiid	0.428 
 2. Curry	0.412 
 3. Randle	0.406 
 4. LaVine	0.404 
 5. Mitchell	0.398 
 6. Brown	0.398 
 7. Leonard	0.391

 19. Booker	0.315 
 20. Fox	0.295

&nbsp;

Ok, so yeah... This data set features the least practicable thing I thought I would see today, and the most predictable thing I would see today.  **When I started off this morning (7 hours ago from the moment I am typing this), I did NOT expect to see that Joel Embiid was going to be the most efficient 3Pt shooter out of the entire top 20 scorers in the league (on a night by night basis).** I will explain how this works in the next breakdown, where I talk about 3Pt% StDev.  Worry not Warriors fans, Steph is still the premiere ""*God Tier*"" 3Pt shooter in the league.

&nbsp;

*Exhales...* Let me begin this by saying that I'm a 30+ year Suns fan.  I pre-date the Barkley trade, and have been with them through all of the good, and all of the bad.  When I was stationed in Europe, I would stay up at crazy hours, just so I could root for the Purple and Orange.  I went to games at the Madhouse on McDowell.  With that out of the way: Devin Booker is a very inefficient 3Pt shooter.  As you've seen in the last game (assuming I get this out before this evening's game), he's not a ""*bad*"" 3Pt shooter (he hit a few HUGE threes), but he is rather inefficient on a night-to-night basis.  You don't even have to watch Suns games to understand this either, you can look at the box scores.  **The league average (this season) was .367 from 3, wanna guess how many games Devin spent below the league average?**  39 games (58% of the games he played this season), including 10 games where he was 0% from 3.  

## **3Pt% (StDev)**

 1. Lillard	0.151 
 2. Curry	0.158 
 3. Tatum	0.180 
 4. Doncic	0.188 
 5. LaVine	0.193 
 6. Fox	0.196 
 7. Brown	0.196 
 8. Ingram	0.200 
 9. Mitchell	0.201 
 10. Booker	0.207 
 11. Beal	0.219 
 12. Young	0.221 
 13. Irving	0.223 
 14. Leonard	0.257 
 15. Randle	0.258 
 16. Antetokounmpo	0.259 
 17. Sexton	0.273 
 18. Jokic	0.305 
 19. Embiid	0.337 
 20. Williamson	0.450

&nbsp;

Lets address the open item from the breakdown before this one.  **Embiid is not an elite 3Pt shooter, he just doesn't shoot a lot (for a 3Pt shooter) and he has a decent number (8 to be exact) of 100% nights (where he went 1/1 or 2/2).**   Yes, Book has 10 nights of 0%, but Embiid has 12 nights of the same percentage.  Roughly 24% of the time Joel steps onto the court, he's going to be a complete dud from 3.

&nbsp;

**Steph is still the gold standard when it comes to 3Pt shooting.**  Lillard is on top of this list, meaning that he's the most consistent, but all that means is that he's the most consistent at bringing home a nightly 3Pt% lower than Steph (8% lower, relatively).  Props to Dame, but Curry is the King, all Hail to the Chef.

## **Nightly Ft% (Average)**

 1. Irving	0.923 
 2. Curry	0.914 
 3. Lillard	0.906 
 4. Young	0.891 
 5. Leonard	0.885 
 6. Beal	0.883 
 7. Booker	0.865 
 8. Tatum	0.864 
 9. Ingram	0.860 
 10. LaVine	0.859 
 11. Jokic	0.857 
 12. Embiid	0.849 
 13. Mitchell	0.827 
 14. Sexton	0.816 
 15. Randle	0.803 
 16. Brown	0.770 
 17. Doncic	0.728 
 18. Williamson	0.707 
 19. Fox	0.705 
 20. Antetokounmpo	0.683

&nbsp;

Well, it was nice knowing you.  This is likely where everyone checks out, if you haven't checked out already (lets be real, this is a wall of text after all).  Not many folks are going to care about Ft%, except for the diehard stat-heads.

&nbsp;

**Kyrie had a 50/40/90 season (and 36 perfect games), Steph is on the same level as Steve Nash when it comes to free throws (he had 36 as well), and Dame is an elite-level free throw shooter as well (38 perfect games for Dolla).**  Not many surprises here.

&nbsp;

**And coming in at the bottom, the Balkan Brick himself, Giannis.**  To be honest though, it's not nearly as bad as I thought it would be, and he only had 1 game of 0% all year

## **FT% (StDev)**

 1. Young	0.116 
 2. Beal	0.131 
 3. Curry	0.134 
 4. Booker	0.152 
 5. Irving	0.154 
 6. Lillard	0.162 
 7. Williamson	0.162 
 8. Embiid	0.163 
 9. Leonard	0.167 
 10. Fox	0.179 
 11. Sexton	0.179 
 12. Randle	0.183 
 13. Tatum	0.190 
 14. Mitchell	0.193 
 15. Jokic	0.195 
 16. Antetokounmpo	0.195 
 17. LaVine	0.201 
 18. Doncic	0.209 
 19. Ingram	0.217 
 20. Brown	0.260

&nbsp;

I'm on the home stretch.  I'm going to make a PB&J sandwich after this, and it's going to be awesome.

&nbsp;

**The reason why I love Trae Young is specifically this.  Yes, he's pretty inefficient, but the man makes up for it at the line.**  He is an elite Ft shooter, and he's massively consistent at being elite.  His consistency at the line is unparalleled, only having one game of below .667 this entire season (Steph had 4, Dame had 3, Kyrie had 2).  

&nbsp;

**Celtics fans, I don't hate your team, Jaylen Brown is just a weird guy.**  His consistency at the line isn't great, but he also hardly gets there on a night to night basis.  Jaylen had nine games this year where he didn't even get to the line at all.  He had two 0% games, which is double what Giannis, but he also had 20 perfect games.  He plays nothing like John Starks, but his consistency is very reminiscent of him.

## **Conclusions**
**If you take anything away from reading this, please understand that EVERYTHING in basketball is relational.** Someone's PPG doesn't matter, if you don't know the percentages behind it.  Someone's ORTG or DRTG means nothing if you don't know specific components of their game behind said rating (case in point, Robin Lopez once led the league in ORTG, look it up, 2013-2014 season).
&nbsp;


**Being consistent is neither good nor bad, without knowing someone's efficiency to begin with.**  Being consistently inefficient is bad, and being inconsistently good is also bad.  They are two wildly different metrics, but they also need each other in order to having any meaning at all.

&nbsp;

I hope you enjoyed my Ted Talk.  Thank you for reading this.

You’d have to add someone else from Denver for salary matching I think but the idea is:

Philly still has a good defensive forward, and will get a lead half court guard/scorer that they can count on. Plus getting off of Tobias’ contract may help with flexibility.

For Denver they get an upgrade on Gordon’s defense in Ben who’s also one of the fastest players in league for transition playmaking and receiving Jokic’s passes.

Tobias would be an upgrade on Gordon’s offense by a lot, and he’s healthy, which unfortunately Jamal Murray will not be til presumably late next season. With Porter and Jokic this would be Denver’s big 4 basically.

You count to ten when Giannis Antetokounmpo attempts a free throw. It is more likely going in when he launches it at 9 or 12

I was just wondering, why can't people count 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 to really throw him off? That would be absolutely devastating and brutal.

It would also confuse the fuck out of him lmao","t3_oi5r55","https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/oi5r55/a_legit_suggestion_to_throw_giannis_off_his_free/",0,36,"t1_h4tb7sr","2021-11-07 8:00:48 AM","Or count down from 10 to actually rush him.

And yet, despite that selfless and generous act, the zygote has not enjoyed full credit for the stats that their other half produces.

What if that changed? What if we gave justice to those noble zygotes? What if we merged the careers of Brook and Robin Lopez into one?

We finally answers those what ifs, as we examine the alternate history of the legendary **[RO-BRO LOPEZ](https://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/06/sports/basketball/brook-and-robin-lopez-with-identical-genes-are-often-a-study-in-contrasts.html)** .

*editor's note: we're just crudely combining their per-game averages here, although that's not the most accurate given that they played different amount of games per year. In fact, technically speaking, these sums should be split in half for proper ""per game"" numbers. Still, if you're looking for factual accuracy, this post may not be for you.*

---

######**the illustrious career of RO-BRO LOPEZ**

**2008-09**: 16.2 points, 10.1 rebounds, 1.1 assists, 2.5 blocks

*As a rookie, Robin Lopez didn't contribute much at all (3 points a game), leaving the Brook side of this conjoined twin act to carry the weight. Fortunately, he's up to the task. Thanks to the extra brotherly boost, Ro-Bro Lopez manages to win ROOKIE OF THE YEAR in a narrow vote over Derrick Rose, who averaged 17-6 for the Bulls.*

**2009-10**: 27.2 points, 13.5 rebounds, 2.4 assists, 2.4 blocks

*Ro-Bro takes a massive step up as a sophomore (fueled largely by Brook's 19-8 in real life). Not only does he snag an ALL-STAR bid, but he becomes a very serious MVP candidate as well. However, the media is still in love with LeBron James and gives the King a repeat MVP after his 30-7-9 campaign (in his last season in Cleveland.) Clearly, LeBron must have sensed the rising threat of Ro-Bro, because he fled to Miami right after this season.*

**2010-11**: 26.8 points, 9.2 rebounds, 1.7 assists, 2.2 blocks

*After many Ro-Bro fans feel like he got snubbed for MVP in the prior season, the outraged boils over when he gets snubbed AGAIN. Bulls star Derrick Rose's impact and narrative outweighed his counting stats (25-8) and helped fuel his campaign. Meanwhile, Ro-Bro split some votes with the other top center Dwight Howard, whose stats are similar (23-14 with 2.4 blocks.) In fact, Ro-Bro's win total of 64 (24 for Brook, 40 for Robin) didn't separate him much either, as Rose's Bulls won 62.*

**2011-12**: 24.6 points, 9.2 rebounds, 1.7 assists, 2.2 blocks

*The Ro-Bro Mania takes a step back after his Brook foot breaks, making Robin carry much of the weight for this season. (Although I suppose Ro-Bro may be a centaur with 4 legs?) Either way, Ro-Bro has a lost season and even misses out on All-Star status for the first time since his rookie year.*

**2012-13**: 30.7 points, 12.5 rebounds, 1.7 assists, 3.7 blocks

*After a down year, Ro-Bro Lopez bounces back in a major way, helped largely by the fact that Robin Lopez would become a starter (for the next 6 seasons.) An ALL-STAR is a certainty, but the MVP comes down to Ro-Bro against an old rival: LeBron James (who won after averaging 27-8-7 for the Heat.) The media once again pushes for the King (coming off his first title in Miami), justified by a growing analytics movement that cited James' win share advantage (of 19.3, compared to a combined 10.9 for the brothers.) Ro-Bro fans are furious with the decision, and cite an unfair bias against multiples.*

**2013-14**: 31.8 points, 14.5 rebounds, 1.8 assists, 3.2 blocks

*Ro-Bro has arguably his best year ever on paper (earning another ALL-STAR), but ends up missing too many games to win MVP again. Brother Brook had another foot injury and only played 17 games. And while that would technically be 99 if you include Robin, we're halving the games and giving him only 45.*

**2014-15**: 27.5 points, 14.2 rebounds, 1.6 assists, 3.2 blocks

*Now at full strength, Ro-Bro puts up another Joel Embiid - like figures, nabs an ALL-STAR, and even wins his first MVP! The actual winner Steph Curry had a great narrative as the Warriors broke out with 67 wins, but Curry's raw numbers (24 points, 8 assists a game) can't match up with the consistent statistical dominance of our embryo.*

**2015-16**: 30.2 points, 15.2 rebounds, 3.4 assists, 3.3 blocks

*Steph Curry gets his revenge. Curry stepped up his play, scoring 30 points a game and leading the Warriors to a record 73 wins. While Ro-Bro's stats may stack up with him, his ""winning"" leaves something to be desired. Brook's Nets and Robin's Knicks combined for a paltry 53 wins (21 and 32, respectively.) An ALL-STAR but not MVP here.*

**2016-17**: 30.5 points, 11.8 rebounds, 3.3 assists, 3.1 blocks

*Another 30-10 season earns Ro-Bro an ALL-STAR and a top 3 MVP finish, but not the trophy itself. Oklahoma City's Russell Westbrook bested him in points (31.6 per game) and almost matched him in rebounds (10.7). In fact, there's some growing criticism about Ro-Bro's rebounding numbers. Sure, 11.8 per game sounds great, but it may be a little underwhelming for a 14-footer.*

**2017-18**: 24.9 points, 8.5 rebounds, 3.6 assists, 2.2 blocks

*As Brook Lopez started to drift more and more to the perimeter, we see Ro-Bro's game evolve in the same way. Unfortunately, Ro-Bro misses the All-Star game for the first time in ages. Part of that is a statistical dip, but part of that is due to the fact that he's split between two losing teams, with the Luke Walton Lakers (Brook) and Fred Hoiberg Bulls (Robin) respectively.*

**2018-19**: 22.1 points, 8.8 rebounds, 2.4 assists, 3.3 blocks

*While Ro-Bro's stats continue to dip, he's rewarded by the media with a one last ALL-STAR trip. He's given a lot of credit for his evolving perimeter game (up to a career-high 2.4 threes per game, 2.3 by Brook) and the fact that's contributing to the ascent of the first-place Milwaukee Bucks.*

**2019-20**: 17.5 points, 7.1 rebounds, 2.1 assists, 3.1 blocks

*At this stage in his career, Ro-Bro will have to focus on defensive awards. He wins another All-Defense team (which Brook did on his own) but isn't in play for All-Stars or MVPs anymore. And at this stage, Ro-Bro doesn't care. He's chasing the one thing that's alluded him in his illustrious career: a title ring.*

**2020-21**: 21.3 points, 8.8 rebounds, 1.5 assists, 2.1 blocks

*Another strong season by Ro-Bro, albeit without any awards. However, he's still in contention to win his first ever championship. In fact, Ro-Bro's chase for his first ring is as big of a story as Chris Paul's.*

**OVERALL**: 25.3 points, 11.3 rebounds, 2.3 assists, 2.9 blocks

*As we look back at Ro-Bro Lopez's great career so far, we have to acknowledge him as one of the best centers of all-time. Among his accolades: 1 Rookie of the Year, 8 All-Star appearances, and 1 MVP trophy (along with a bunch of defensive trophies.) His closest comparison may be David Robinson, who won an MVP and averaged 21.1 points, 10.6 rebounds, and 3.0 blocks over the course of his career. Unfortunately for Ro-Bro Lopez, he is still lacking a ring that other great centers have enjoyed as the topper for their career. But make no mistake about it, that career ends with Ro-Bro earning his place in the HALL of FAME.

\---

There was a podcast episode last year when J.J. Redick and Damian Lillard talked about how Chris Paul is one of the few guys in the league who ""try to manipulate every single play"":

https://reddit.com/link/oiw9vx/video/ryt49bj4ita71/player

And it's true. CP is a master of finding advantages - whether it be a matchup, an angle on a screen-and-roll, a foul call - whatever he can or has to do to get one, he'll probably do it.

This is most obvious when he's hunting for matchups. In this Suns-Bucks series, that's usually Brook Lopez or Bobby Portis - two guys that struggle to defend pick-and-rolls in space.

Here's a possession from Game 3 last night where Chris calls for multiple screens in attempt to get Brook involved:

https://reddit.com/link/oiw9vx/video/a633e9a9ita71/player

Brilliant play from both the Suns and the Bucks here; it's an \~18 second chess match. Let's break it down:

1. Phoenix pushes the ball up in transition and the Bucks are crossmatched. Brook is left picking up Chris Paul. Brook and Jrue Holiday quickly scram switch before the ball finds Chris.
2. Chris catches the ball with 15 seconds on the shot clock. Milwaukee is now matched up properly: Jrue on CP, Giannis on Jae Crowder, Brook on Cam Johnson.
3. Chris obviously doesn't want Jrue on him; Crowder gives him a screen to switch Giannis Antetokounmpo onto him, then sprints to the corner to get Brook's man (Johnson) to come up for another screen.
4. Jrue and Brook sniff out what Phoenix is trying to do, so they scram switch again. On Johnson's screen, Chris is immediately picked back up by Holiday. No good.
5. But now Cam clears and takes Giannis with him. That isolates Jrue and Brook on one side of the floor, and Chris immediately attacks it. He and Jae run a little pitch/slip screen/pop.
6. Jrue has to stick with Chris because they don't want Brook isolated on him, Brook has to drop at first to prevent the drive, and it allows Crowder to get open for a wide open 3. Splash.

If you're counting, that's three screens and four switches in just nine seconds. Milwaukee did about as well as they could, but Chris Paul and the Suns were simply a little bit better.

\---

Another cool moment from G3:

The Suns' ball movement on display once again...

https://reddit.com/link/oiw9vx/video/dhnht5inita71/player

On the very next possession, as the Suns were about to go swing swing swing around the perimeter again, Giannis said ""hell no"" to that and rotated to the passing lane instead of to the shooter:

https://reddit.com/link/oiw9vx/video/jbrlwghqita71/player

It looks bad if you isolate it, but it was probably a smart move making Cameron Payne attempt an off-the-dribble 3 off of a pass fake instead of letting Crowder shoot another catch-and-shoot 3 from the spot he had just made one from.

I'd like to hear how the reffing impacted some of the play, sure, but I doubt Foster is enough to cause a team as good as the Suns to get blown out. So what adjustments both before and during the game did Bud/Monty make that helped or hurt their teams? Were there any significant differences in who played and for how long? Which players had the biggest impact, good or bad? Can the Bucks do what they did last night consistently? 

Disclaimer: This is a question *primarily* for people who are neutral towards the Suns but if you can give a fair answer as a non-neutral fan, I'll take it. It's also for people who watched all 3 games and can break down changes in the Bucks' defensive and offensive strategies beyond 'Giannis is driving to the basket more/less'. I'm looking for ones who know their Xs and Os.

I think the Nuggets, if their top 4 players (Jokic-Murray-Porter Jr-Gordon) can remain healthy, will be the team to beat in the West next year.

MVP-level Jokic and Murray as a reasonable 2nd offensive option proved good enough to be a Top 3-4 team in the West alone.  Add a 3rd year Porter Jr, who I'd put as a dark horse to be an all-star next year and actually become their 2nd best player next year, and I think they should be title contenders (given decent health).  Porter Jr. shot an absolutely shocking 54% FG, 44% 3PFG, and a 65% eFG (which was 4th best in the entire league), without the easiest shot selection.

On top of that Big 3, there's Gordon - Aaron Gordon absolutely has his flaws as a player, but as a pretty clear 4th option on a team he more than enough is capable of being a huge contributor to this team.  His strengths as a player will also be maximized by the spacing that Murray + Porter Jr provide and how gifted of a post passer Jokic is.

They have two very solid rotation players under contract (Monte Morris and JaMychal Green), serivceable PG depth in Campazzo, a possible return from Barton (who has a player option), and a wild card 3rd year Bol Bol, depth shouldn't be an incredible issue either - they'll need to fill out some good 3-D players to make up some defensive deficiencies, but I can imagine given Denver's core they should be able to attract some good options.

Murray-Morris/Barton-Porter Jr-Gordon-Jokic with Morris/Barton, Campazzo, Green + 3+D signings, rookies, vet mins should go toe-to-toe with anyone.","t3_oiswm8","https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/oiswm8/prediction_the_denver_nuggets_will_be_the_best/",0,66,"t1_h4xej48","2021-12-07 8:10:12 AM","We're a Zeke Nnaji turning into Mikal Bridges away",7,0,1,0,0,1.5

\---

There was a podcast episode last year when J.J. Redick and Damian Lillard talked about how Chris Paul is one of the few guys in the league who ""try to manipulate every single play"":

https://reddit.com/link/oiw9vx/video/ryt49bj4ita71/player

And it's true. CP is a master of finding advantages - whether it be a matchup, an angle on a screen-and-roll, a foul call - whatever he can or has to do to get one, he'll probably do it.

This is most obvious when he's hunting for matchups. In this Suns-Bucks series, that's usually Brook Lopez or Bobby Portis - two guys that struggle to defend pick-and-rolls in space.

Here's a possession from Game 3 last night where Chris calls for multiple screens in attempt to get Brook involved:

https://reddit.com/link/oiw9vx/video/a633e9a9ita71/player

Brilliant play from both the Suns and the Bucks here; it's an \~18 second chess match. Let's break it down:

1. Phoenix pushes the ball up in transition and the Bucks are crossmatched. Brook is left picking up Chris Paul. Brook and Jrue Holiday quickly scram switch before the ball finds Chris.
2. Chris catches the ball with 15 seconds on the shot clock. Milwaukee is now matched up properly: Jrue on CP, Giannis on Jae Crowder, Brook on Cam Johnson.
3. Chris obviously doesn't want Jrue on him; Crowder gives him a screen to switch Giannis Antetokounmpo onto him, then sprints to the corner to get Brook's man (Johnson) to come up for another screen.
4. Jrue and Brook sniff out what Phoenix is trying to do, so they scram switch again. On Johnson's screen, Chris is immediately picked back up by Holiday. No good.
5. But now Cam clears and takes Giannis with him. That isolates Jrue and Brook on one side of the floor, and Chris immediately attacks it. He and Jae run a little pitch/slip screen/pop.
6. Jrue has to stick with Chris because they don't want Brook isolated on him, Brook has to drop at first to prevent the drive, and it allows Crowder to get open for a wide open 3. Splash.

If you're counting, that's three screens and four switches in just nine seconds. Milwaukee did about as well as they could, but Chris Paul and the Suns were simply a little bit better.

\---

Another cool moment from G3:

The Suns' ball movement on display once again...

https://reddit.com/link/oiw9vx/video/dhnht5inita71/player

On the very next possession, as the Suns were about to go swing swing swing around the perimeter again, Giannis said ""hell no"" to that and rotated to the passing lane instead of to the shooter:

https://reddit.com/link/oiw9vx/video/jbrlwghqita71/player

It looks bad if you isolate it, but it was probably a smart move making Cameron Payne attempt an off-the-dribble 3 off of a pass fake instead of letting Crowder shoot another catch-and-shoot 3 from the spot he had just made one from.

I always love watching players adjust on the fly from possession to possession.","t3_oiw9vx","https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/oiw9vx/chris_paul_will_get_the_switch_he_wants_you_a_big/",51,12,"t1_h4y3871","2021-12-07 11:07:23 AM","This is the biggest issue with losing Donte.

For context, since Federer won the first title in 2003, there have been 72 grand slams. These 3 have won 60 of them. 83.3% of all titles have gone to just three players. 

For more context, that's 3 players with 20 titles. The next highest is Pete Sampras at 14. Roy Emerson at 12. Borg and Laver at 11. Tilden with 10. And they don't overlap

From the little I saw of him this season it seemed like his midrange has improved considerably since last season and his defense has also gotten a bit better. The dude is getting close to winning an DPOY especially with Gobert winning his fourth and voters fatigue to probably set in.

You count to ten when Giannis Antetokounmpo attempts a free throw. It is more likely going in when he launches it at 9 or 12

I was just wondering, why can't people count 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 to really throw him off? That would be absolutely devastating and brutal.

It would also confuse the fuck out of him lmao","t3_oi5r55","https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/oi5r55/a_legit_suggestion_to_throw_giannis_off_his_free/",0,36,"t1_h4ta7wz","2021-11-07 7:52:09 AM","I keep thinking if we count it like really really fast",2,0,0.783,0.217,0.3612,3.67

By [EPM](https://dunksandthrees.com/epm), Luka had a +5.3 offensive EPM (4th highest in the league) and a +0.0 defensive EPM. Steph had a +7.4 offensive EPM (best in league) and a -0.6 defensive EPM. I think it's fair to say that both of them are legendary tier offensive talents but not really impactful defenders. No hate, same boat as Magic who's easily a top 10 player all-time.

My question is do y'all think it's **realistic** for a player like this to surpass MJ/LeBron as the GOAT?

Emphasis on realistic because yeah obviously if they're a 50 PPG, 60% 3PT player then they'll be the GOAT.

But REALISTICALLY do you think an average defensive player can have a big enough offensive gap ahead of MJ/LeBron to make up for the massive difference in defense? I mean, MJ is the greatest scorer ever and LeBron is both an all-time great scorer and playmaker. 

It seems pretty unrealistic, right?

There was a podcast episode last year when J.J. Redick and Damian Lillard talked about how Chris Paul is one of the few guys in the league who ""try to manipulate every single play"":

https://reddit.com/link/oiw9vx/video/ryt49bj4ita71/player

And it's true. CP is a master of finding advantages - whether it be a matchup, an angle on a screen-and-roll, a foul call - whatever he can or has to do to get one, he'll probably do it.

This is most obvious when he's hunting for matchups. In this Suns-Bucks series, that's usually Brook Lopez or Bobby Portis - two guys that struggle to defend pick-and-rolls in space.

Here's a possession from Game 3 last night where Chris calls for multiple screens in attempt to get Brook involved:

https://reddit.com/link/oiw9vx/video/a633e9a9ita71/player

Brilliant play from both the Suns and the Bucks here; it's an \~18 second chess match. Let's break it down:

1. Phoenix pushes the ball up in transition and the Bucks are crossmatched. Brook is left picking up Chris Paul. Brook and Jrue Holiday quickly scram switch before the ball finds Chris.
2. Chris catches the ball with 15 seconds on the shot clock. Milwaukee is now matched up properly: Jrue on CP, Giannis on Jae Crowder, Brook on Cam Johnson.
3. Chris obviously doesn't want Jrue on him; Crowder gives him a screen to switch Giannis Antetokounmpo onto him, then sprints to the corner to get Brook's man (Johnson) to come up for another screen.
4. Jrue and Brook sniff out what Phoenix is trying to do, so they scram switch again. On Johnson's screen, Chris is immediately picked back up by Holiday. No good.
5. But now Cam clears and takes Giannis with him. That isolates Jrue and Brook on one side of the floor, and Chris immediately attacks it. He and Jae run a little pitch/slip screen/pop.
6. Jrue has to stick with Chris because they don't want Brook isolated on him, Brook has to drop at first to prevent the drive, and it allows Crowder to get open for a wide open 3. Splash.

If you're counting, that's three screens and four switches in just nine seconds. Milwaukee did about as well as they could, but Chris Paul and the Suns were simply a little bit better.

Another cool moment from G3:

On the very next possession, as the Suns were about to go swing swing swing around the perimeter again, Giannis said ""hell no"" to that and rotated to the passing lane instead of to the shooter:

https://reddit.com/link/oiw9vx/video/jbrlwghqita71/player

It looks bad if you isolate it, but it was probably a smart move making Cameron Payne attempt an off-the-dribble 3 off of a pass fake instead of letting Crowder shoot another catch-and-shoot 3 from the spot he had just made one from.

If you're a stat-head like me, you likely spend a lot of time looking at every chart for a given player on Basketball Reference (or insert your stat site of choice).  There is a lot of powerful information in available metrics (especially adjusted shooting), but the one area where stats seem a bit deficient, is **quantifying ""consistency"" and ""efficiency""**.  
 
&nbsp;

Player ""X"" may average 25ppg on 55% Fg and 40% 3Pt, but that doesn't tell you anything about the spread of data.  Basically, it's difficult to look at a cumulative stat sheet for a player, and derive how often that 25ppg/55% Fg/40% 3Pt player shows up each night.  The lack of a consistency metric leads to a lot of speculative opinions about players; ""Player 'X' is good, but he's streaky and has a lot of hot and cold nights.""  Without watching every single game for Player ""X"", or looking at the entire gamelog for a season, it's difficult to have a response to said speculation, without you speculating as well, leading to *an ouroboros of speculation*.  
  
&nbsp;

This morning, I sat down, and went through the entire season of gamelogs for each of the top 20 scorers in the NBA, to provide both myself, as well as you all, with a little bit of clarity on how consistent, and efficient each of those players are.  

&nbsp;

# **Understandings (please read this)**  
There are two very important understandings that must be had, when looking at this data.  They are:

 * Nightly Average Shooting %
 * Standard Deviation (or StDev)

&nbsp;

## **Nightly Average Shooting %**

While this is the ""less complicated"" of the two, I am covering this one first, because I know this one will cause the most confusion.  

&nbsp;

The shooting percentages you see on a stat sheet, are an *average of cumulative metrics*.  The shooting percentages you will see in my tables, do not take this into consideration, because an average of all shots for an entire season doesn't tell you anything about consistency.

&nbsp;

 **Example**
For this example, lets take an imaginary 7 game series (to make this as simple as possible).  In this scenario, lets say Steph Curry had 3Pt shooting nights of:

* 10/10  
* 10/10  
* 0/5  
* 0/2  
* 0/3  
* 0/4  
* 0/5 

&nbsp;

Steph's 3pt shooting percentage of this series would be 20/39, or 51.28%.  If you just looked at that 51.28%, you would think ""*How did the Warriors lose?  Steph shot over 50% from 3!*""  The actual truth would be that **for over half the series, Steph shot very poorly**, he had 2 great games, and 5 bad games.  His **Nightly Average 3pt%** would be 28.57% ( much lower than his series 3Pt% of 51.28%). 

&nbsp; 

## **Standard Deviation (StDev)**  
  
This one is going to be a bit rough, and I'm going to keep it as simple as possible.  Professional data scientists, actual statisticians, and people that are REALLY deep into ""*stonks*"" will know what this is without having to read this section.  
  
&nbsp;

Here is a very layman's explanation of StDev and what you need to know:  
  
 1. StDev is the measurement of volatility of a data set.  Basically, how spread the data is.  
 2. **LOWER IS ALWAYS BETTER when consistency is a concern**  
 3. It's a bit more complicated than this, and without boring you with a lot of math, if you're curious on how StDev works, there are some great YouTube videos that describe it in a very digestible/visual way.  There is no shame in watching them, because even I had to do it, 5 years ago, when I first started using StDev as a method to evaluate data in my primary hobby, astrophotography.  
&nbsp;

## **The Actual Data!**  

*Note 1: This data is sorted by actual PPG, I will have breakdowns of each section below the table*  
*Note 2: Bold means ""leader among the Top 20""*  
*Note 3: Italics means ""worst among the Top 20""*

This list doesn't need a lot of analysis, you can get this list directly from Basketball Reference.  You don't/shouldn't need anyone to break down PPG for you.  If PPG were a TV show, it would be ""The Office"", because everyone can understand it, and everyone quotes it.

&nbsp;

I guess all of the ""robotic"" jokes about Kawhi Leonard have some statistical basis.  **Out of all of the top 20 scorers, Kawhi had the greatest chance of bringing every point of that 24.8 PPG to the table each game.**  His season high was 36 points, and his low was 13 points.

&nbsp;

Curry, well, when you carry a team that hard, I guess there will be a lot of fluctuation in your points output.  **His season average was 31.98 (basically 32), and he had 29 games of sub-average performance, and three games where he didn't even score half of his season average.**  His season high was 62 points (18 ft, 8 threes, and 18 buckets overall), and his season low was 11 (2 of 16 shooting for that game). 

## **Nightly Fg% (Average)**

 1. Williamson	0.621 
 2. Jokic	0.576 
 3. Antetokounmpo	0.574 
 4. Leonard	0.521 
 5. Embiid	0.508 
 6. Irving	0.506

 17. Randle	0.452 
 18. Lillard	0.449 
 19. Mitchell	0.443 
 20. Young	0.432

&nbsp;

I doubt there is much surprise about the top, or the bottom of this list.  Zion is a dunk machine, almost 70% of his shots take place 0-3 feet from the basket, and nobody is going to stop his 284 lbs of fury.  **Ben Simmons, passing out of a wide open dunk, needs to watch some Zion footage.**

&nbsp;

The bottom of this list features two heavy volume shooters in Donovan Mitchell and Trae Young.  While 44% nightly field goal percentage isn't ""bad"", it's not great.  If you look at a lot of Hawks and/or Jazz box scores, you probably already had an inkling that neither of these two folks have an overwhelming amount of efficient nights.  **Mitchell had 10 nights this season where he shot worse than 35%, and Trae said ""*hold my beer*"" with 17 of his own nights (this is over 1/4th of his entire games played this season).**  Mitchell and Young are, at the very minimum, average in their TS+ (Trae being 103 and Mitchell being exactly league average at 100, though his actual TS is below league average .569 to .572), but both definitely struggle with consistent efficiency.

## **FG% (StDev)**

 17. Young	0.130 
 18. Embiid	0.131 
 19. Williamson	0.133 
 20. Brown	0.134

&nbsp;

The top two, and bottom two, tell interesting stories.  Being ""consistent"" isn't always good, but it's also not always bad, it's all about context.  If you're a 25% shooter, you WANT your consistency to be way off, because you don't want to show up, every single night, and give 25% to your team.  **Luka leads the pack here, but it's not as good as Kawhi's efficiency, because Luka is extremely consistent at being averagely efficient (when compared to the top 20 here, as his average nightly Fg% is in the bottom half of this pack).**  Kawhi is in the top 5 for average nightly Fg%, as well as being 2nd on the list of standard deviation among his Fg% data.

&nbsp;

The bottom two, well ""*The Lord giveth, and the Lord taketh away*"".  Zion is, by far, the most efficient on a night by night basis, but due to the fact that his nightly Fg% is so absurdly high, he's going to have a decent amount of games where his Fg% is in the range of mere mortals.  **Zion had an impressive 10 games this season where he shot over 75%, but he also had 31 games this season where he shot below his nightly Fg% (though only 3 games where he was below 45%!).** 

&nbsp;

The Jaylen Brown stats are not that bad, hold those downvotes Celtics fans.  Yes, he's wildly inconsistent when compared to everyone else in this top 20, BUT, he's inconsistent on the good side.  He's 8th in his nightly Fg%, .490, pretty good.  **He had 29 games this season (over half his entire season) where he shot above that mark of .490, including an 85% night (17/20 shooting).**. Yeah, he's a bit erratic, but over half the time when he steps on the court, you're getting the ""*good*"" type of erratic; The type of erratic that John Starks fans loved.

## **Nightly 3pt% (Average)**

 1. Embiid	0.428 
 2. Curry	0.412 
 3. Randle	0.406

&nbsp;

Ok, so yeah... This data set features the least practicable thing I thought I would see today, and the most predictable thing I would see today.  **When I started off this morning (7 hours ago from the moment I am typing this), I did NOT expect to see that Joel Embiid was going to be the most efficient 3Pt shooter out of the entire top 20 scorers in the league (on a night by night basis).** I will explain how this works in the next breakdown, where I talk about 3Pt% StDev.  Worry not Warriors fans, Steph is still the premiere ""*God Tier*"" 3Pt shooter in the league.

&nbsp;

*Exhales...* Let me begin this by saying that I'm a 30+ year Suns fan.  I pre-date the Barkley trade, and have been with them through all of the good, and all of the bad.  When I was stationed in Europe, I would stay up at crazy hours, just so I could root for the Purple and Orange.  I went to games at the Madhouse on McDowell.  With that out of the way: Devin Booker is a very inefficient 3Pt shooter.  As you've seen in the last game (assuming I get this out before this evening's game), he's not a ""*bad*"" 3Pt shooter (he hit a few HUGE threes), but he is rather inefficient on a night-to-night basis.  You don't even have to watch Suns games to understand this either, you can look at the box scores.  **The league average (this season) was .367 from 3, wanna guess how many games Devin spent below the league average?**  39 games (58% of the games he played this season), including 10 games where he was 0% from 3.  

## **3Pt% (StDev)**

 1. Lillard	0.151 
 2. Curry	0.158 
 3. Tatum	0.180 
 4. Doncic	0.188 
 5. LaVine	0.193 
 6. Fox	0.196 
 7. Brown	0.196 
 8. Ingram	0.200 
 9. Mitchell	0.201 
 10. Booker	0.207 
 11. Beal	0.219 
 12. Young	0.221 
 13. Irving	0.223 
 14. Leonard	0.257 
 15. Randle	0.258 
 16. Antetokounmpo	0.259 
 17. Sexton	0.273 
 18. Jokic	0.305 
 19. Embiid	0.337 
 20. Williamson	0.450

&nbsp;

Lets address the open item from the breakdown before this one.  **Embiid is not an elite 3Pt shooter, he just doesn't shoot a lot (for a 3Pt shooter) and he has a decent number (8 to be exact) of 100% nights (where he went 1/1 or 2/2).**   Yes, Book has 10 nights of 0%, but Embiid has 12 nights of the same percentage.  Roughly 24% of the time Joel steps onto the court, he's going to be a complete dud from 3.

&nbsp;

**Steph is still the gold standard when it comes to 3Pt shooting.**  Lillard is on top of this list, meaning that he's the most consistent, but all that means is that he's the most consistent at bringing home a nightly 3Pt% lower than Steph (8% lower, relatively).  Props to Dame, but Curry is the King, all Hail to the Chef.

## **Nightly Ft% (Average)**

 1. Irving	0.923 
 2. Curry	0.914 
 3. Lillard	0.906 
 4. Young	0.891 
 5. Leonard	0.885 
 6. Beal	0.883 
 7. Booker	0.865 
 8. Tatum	0.864 
 9. Ingram	0.860 
 10. LaVine	0.859 
 11. Jokic	0.857 
 12. Embiid	0.849 
 13. Mitchell	0.827 
 14. Sexton	0.816 
 15. Randle	0.803 
 16. Brown	0.770 
 17. Doncic	0.728 
 18. Williamson	0.707 
 19. Fox	0.705 
 20. Antetokounmpo	0.683

&nbsp;

Well, it was nice knowing you.  This is likely where everyone checks out, if you haven't checked out already (lets be real, this is a wall of text after all).  Not many folks are going to care about Ft%, except for the diehard stat-heads.

&nbsp;

**Kyrie had a 50/40/90 season (and 36 perfect games), Steph is on the same level as Steve Nash when it comes to free throws (he had 36 as well), and Dame is an elite-level free throw shooter as well (38 perfect games for Dolla).**  Not many surprises here.

&nbsp;

**And coming in at the bottom, the Balkan Brick himself, Giannis.**  To be honest though, it's not nearly as bad as I thought it would be, and he only had 1 game of 0% all year

## **FT% (StDev)**

 1. Young	0.116 
 2. Beal	0.131 
 3. Curry	0.134 
 4. Booker	0.152 
 5. Irving	0.154 
 6. Lillard	0.162 
 7. Williamson	0.162 
 8. Embiid	0.163 
 9. Leonard	0.167 
 10. Fox	0.179 
 11. Sexton	0.179 
 12. Randle	0.183 
 13. Tatum	0.190 
 14. Mitchell	0.193 
 15. Jokic	0.195 
 16. Antetokounmpo	0.195 
 17. LaVine	0.201 
 18. Doncic	0.209 
 19. Ingram	0.217 
 20. Brown	0.260

&nbsp;

I'm on the home stretch.  I'm going to make a PB&J sandwich after this, and it's going to be awesome.

&nbsp;

**The reason why I love Trae Young is specifically this.  Yes, he's pretty inefficient, but the man makes up for it at the line.**  He is an elite Ft shooter, and he's massively consistent at being elite.  His consistency at the line is unparalleled, only having one game of below .667 this entire season (Steph had 4, Dame had 3, Kyrie had 2).  

&nbsp;

**Celtics fans, I don't hate your team, Jaylen Brown is just a weird guy.**  His consistency at the line isn't great, but he also hardly gets there on a night to night basis.  Jaylen had nine games this year where he didn't even get to the line at all.  He had two 0% games, which is double what Giannis, but he also had 20 perfect games.  He plays nothing like John Starks, but his consistency is very reminiscent of him.

## **Conclusions**
**If you take anything away from reading this, please understand that EVERYTHING in basketball is relational.** Someone's PPG doesn't matter, if you don't know the percentages behind it.  Someone's ORTG or DRTG means nothing if you don't know specific components of their game behind said rating (case in point, Robin Lopez once led the league in ORTG, look it up, 2013-2014 season).
&nbsp;


**Being consistent is neither good nor bad, without knowing someone's efficiency to begin with.**  Being consistently inefficient is bad, and being inconsistently good is also bad.  They are two wildly different metrics, but they also need each other in order to having any meaning at all.

&nbsp;

I hope you enjoyed my Ted Talk.  Thank you for reading this.

If you're a stat-head like me, you likely spend a lot of time looking at every chart for a given player on Basketball Reference (or insert your stat site of choice).  There is a lot of powerful information in available metrics (especially adjusted shooting), but the one area where stats seem a bit deficient, is **quantifying ""consistency"" and ""efficiency""**.  
 
&nbsp;

Player ""X"" may average 25ppg on 55% Fg and 40% 3Pt, but that doesn't tell you anything about the spread of data.  Basically, it's difficult to look at a cumulative stat sheet for a player, and derive how often that 25ppg/55% Fg/40% 3Pt player shows up each night.  The lack of a consistency metric leads to a lot of speculative opinions about players; ""Player 'X' is good, but he's streaky and has a lot of hot and cold nights.""  Without watching every single game for Player ""X"", or looking at the entire gamelog for a season, it's difficult to have a response to said speculation, without you speculating as well, leading to *an ouroboros of speculation*.  
  
&nbsp;

This morning, I sat down, and went through the entire season of gamelogs for each of the top 20 scorers in the NBA, to provide both myself, as well as you all, with a little bit of clarity on how consistent, and efficient each of those players are.  

&nbsp;

# **Understandings (please read this)**  
There are two very important understandings that must be had, when looking at this data.  They are:

 * Nightly Average Shooting %
 * Standard Deviation (or StDev)

&nbsp;

## **Nightly Average Shooting %**

While this is the ""less complicated"" of the two, I am covering this one first, because I know this one will cause the most confusion.  

&nbsp;

The shooting percentages you see on a stat sheet, are an *average of cumulative metrics*.  The shooting percentages you will see in my tables, do not take this into consideration, because an average of all shots for an entire season doesn't tell you anything about consistency.

&nbsp;

 **Example**
For this example, lets take an imaginary 7 game series (to make this as simple as possible).  In this scenario, lets say Steph Curry had 3Pt shooting nights of:

* 10/10  
* 10/10  
* 0/5  
* 0/2  
* 0/3  
* 0/4  
* 0/5 

&nbsp;

Steph's 3pt shooting percentage of this series would be 20/39, or 51.28%.  If you just looked at that 51.28%, you would think ""*How did the Warriors lose?  Steph shot over 50% from 3!*""  The actual truth would be that **for over half the series, Steph shot very poorly**, he had 2 great games, and 5 bad games.  His **Nightly Average 3pt%** would be 28.57% ( much lower than his series 3Pt% of 51.28%). 

&nbsp; 

## **Standard Deviation (StDev)**  
  
This one is going to be a bit rough, and I'm going to keep it as simple as possible.  Professional data scientists, actual statisticians, and people that are REALLY deep into ""*stonks*"" will know what this is without having to read this section.  
  
&nbsp;

Here is a very layman's explanation of StDev and what you need to know:  
  
 1. StDev is the measurement of volatility of a data set.  Basically, how spread the data is.  
 2. **LOWER IS ALWAYS BETTER when consistency is a concern**  
 3. It's a bit more complicated than this, and without boring you with a lot of math, if you're curious on how StDev works, there are some great YouTube videos that describe it in a very digestible/visual way.  There is no shame in watching them, because even I had to do it, 5 years ago, when I first started using StDev as a method to evaluate data in my primary hobby, astrophotography.  
&nbsp;

## **The Actual Data!**  

*Note 1: This data is sorted by actual PPG, I will have breakdowns of each section below the table*  
*Note 2: Bold means ""leader among the Top 20""*  
*Note 3: Italics means ""worst among the Top 20""*

This list doesn't need a lot of analysis, you can get this list directly from Basketball Reference.  You don't/shouldn't need anyone to break down PPG for you.  If PPG were a TV show, it would be ""The Office"", because everyone can understand it, and everyone quotes it.

&nbsp;

I guess all of the ""robotic"" jokes about Kawhi Leonard have some statistical basis.  **Out of all of the top 20 scorers, Kawhi had the greatest chance of bringing every point of that 24.8 PPG to the table each game.**  His season high was 36 points, and his low was 13 points.

&nbsp;

Curry, well, when you carry a team that hard, I guess there will be a lot of fluctuation in your points output.  **His season average was 31.98 (basically 32), and he had 29 games of sub-average performance, and three games where he didn't even score half of his season average.**  His season high was 62 points (18 ft, 8 threes, and 18 buckets overall), and his season low was 11 (2 of 16 shooting for that game). 

## **Nightly Fg% (Average)**

 19. Mitchell	0.443 
 20. Young	0.432

&nbsp;

I doubt there is much surprise about the top, or the bottom of this list.  Zion is a dunk machine, almost 70% of his shots take place 0-3 feet from the basket, and nobody is going to stop his 284 lbs of fury.  **Ben Simmons, passing out of a wide open dunk, needs to watch some Zion footage.**

&nbsp;

The bottom of this list features two heavy volume shooters in Donovan Mitchell and Trae Young.  While 44% nightly field goal percentage isn't ""bad"", it's not great.  If you look at a lot of Hawks and/or Jazz box scores, you probably already had an inkling that neither of these two folks have an overwhelming amount of efficient nights.  **Mitchell had 10 nights this season where he shot worse than 35%, and Trae said ""*hold my beer*"" with 17 of his own nights (this is over 1/4th of his entire games played this season).**  Mitchell and Young are, at the very minimum, average in their TS+ (Trae being 103 and Mitchell being exactly league average at 100, though his actual TS is below league average .569 to .572), but both definitely struggle with consistent efficiency.

## **FG% (StDev)**

 1. Doncic	0.090 
 2. Leonard	0.098 
 3. Booker	0.101 
 4. Sexton	0.106

 17. Young	0.130 
 18. Embiid	0.131 
 19. Williamson	0.133 
 20. Brown	0.134

&nbsp;

The top two, and bottom two, tell interesting stories.  Being ""consistent"" isn't always good, but it's also not always bad, it's all about context.  If you're a 25% shooter, you WANT your consistency to be way off, because you don't want to show up, every single night, and give 25% to your team.  **Luka leads the pack here, but it's not as good as Kawhi's efficiency, because Luka is extremely consistent at being averagely efficient (when compared to the top 20 here, as his average nightly Fg% is in the bottom half of this pack).**  Kawhi is in the top 5 for average nightly Fg%, as well as being 2nd on the list of standard deviation among his Fg% data.

&nbsp;

The bottom two, well ""*The Lord giveth, and the Lord taketh away*"".  Zion is, by far, the most efficient on a night by night basis, but due to the fact that his nightly Fg% is so absurdly high, he's going to have a decent amount of games where his Fg% is in the range of mere mortals.  **Zion had an impressive 10 games this season where he shot over 75%, but he also had 31 games this season where he shot below his nightly Fg% (though only 3 games where he was below 45%!).** 

&nbsp;

The Jaylen Brown stats are not that bad, hold those downvotes Celtics fans.  Yes, he's wildly inconsistent when compared to everyone else in this top 20, BUT, he's inconsistent on the good side.  He's 8th in his nightly Fg%, .490, pretty good.  **He had 29 games this season (over half his entire season) where he shot above that mark of .490, including an 85% night (17/20 shooting).**. Yeah, he's a bit erratic, but over half the time when he steps on the court, you're getting the ""*good*"" type of erratic; The type of erratic that John Starks fans loved.

## **Nightly 3pt% (Average)**

 1. Embiid	0.428 
 2. Curry	0.412 
 3. Randle	0.406

&nbsp;

Ok, so yeah... This data set features the least practicable thing I thought I would see today, and the most predictable thing I would see today.  **When I started off this morning (7 hours ago from the moment I am typing this), I did NOT expect to see that Joel Embiid was going to be the most efficient 3Pt shooter out of the entire top 20 scorers in the league (on a night by night basis).** I will explain how this works in the next breakdown, where I talk about 3Pt% StDev.  Worry not Warriors fans, Steph is still the premiere ""*God Tier*"" 3Pt shooter in the league.

&nbsp;

*Exhales...* Let me begin this by saying that I'm a 30+ year Suns fan.  I pre-date the Barkley trade, and have been with them through all of the good, and all of the bad.  When I was stationed in Europe, I would stay up at crazy hours, just so I could root for the Purple and Orange.  I went to games at the Madhouse on McDowell.  With that out of the way: Devin Booker is a very inefficient 3Pt shooter.  As you've seen in the last game (assuming I get this out before this evening's game), he's not a ""*bad*"" 3Pt shooter (he hit a few HUGE threes), but he is rather inefficient on a night-to-night basis.  You don't even have to watch Suns games to understand this either, you can look at the box scores.  **The league average (this season) was .367 from 3, wanna guess how many games Devin spent below the league average?**  39 games (58% of the games he played this season), including 10 games where he was 0% from 3.  

## **3Pt% (StDev)**

 1. Lillard	0.151 
 2. Curry	0.158 
 3. Tatum	0.180 
 4. Doncic	0.188 
 5. LaVine	0.193 
 6. Fox	0.196 
 7. Brown	0.196 
 8. Ingram	0.200 
 9. Mitchell	0.201 
 10. Booker	0.207 
 11. Beal	0.219 
 12. Young	0.221 
 13. Irving	0.223 
 14. Leonard	0.257 
 15. Randle	0.258 
 16. Antetokounmpo	0.259 
 17. Sexton	0.273 
 18. Jokic	0.305 
 19. Embiid	0.337 
 20. Williamson	0.450

&nbsp;

Lets address the open item from the breakdown before this one.  **Embiid is not an elite 3Pt shooter, he just doesn't shoot a lot (for a 3Pt shooter) and he has a decent number (8 to be exact) of 100% nights (where he went 1/1 or 2/2).**   Yes, Book has 10 nights of 0%, but Embiid has 12 nights of the same percentage.  Roughly 24% of the time Joel steps onto the court, he's going to be a complete dud from 3.

&nbsp;

**Steph is still the gold standard when it comes to 3Pt shooting.**  Lillard is on top of this list, meaning that he's the most consistent, but all that means is that he's the most consistent at bringing home a nightly 3Pt% lower than Steph (8% lower, relatively).  Props to Dame, but Curry is the King, all Hail to the Chef.

## **Nightly Ft% (Average)**

 1. Irving	0.923 
 2. Curry	0.914 
 3. Lillard	0.906 
 4. Young	0.891 
 5. Leonard	0.885 
 6. Beal	0.883 
 7. Booker	0.865 
 8. Tatum	0.864 
 9. Ingram	0.860 
 10. LaVine	0.859 
 11. Jokic	0.857 
 12. Embiid	0.849 
 13. Mitchell	0.827 
 14. Sexton	0.816 
 15. Randle	0.803 
 16. Brown	0.770 
 17. Doncic	0.728 
 18. Williamson	0.707 
 19. Fox	0.705 
 20. Antetokounmpo	0.683

&nbsp;

Well, it was nice knowing you.  This is likely where everyone checks out, if you haven't checked out already (lets be real, this is a wall of text after all).  Not many folks are going to care about Ft%, except for the diehard stat-heads.

&nbsp;

**Kyrie had a 50/40/90 season (and 36 perfect games), Steph is on the same level as Steve Nash when it comes to free throws (he had 36 as well), and Dame is an elite-level free throw shooter as well (38 perfect games for Dolla).**  Not many surprises here.

&nbsp;

**And coming in at the bottom, the Balkan Brick himself, Giannis.**  To be honest though, it's not nearly as bad as I thought it would be, and he only had 1 game of 0% all year

## **FT% (StDev)**

 1. Young	0.116 
 2. Beal	0.131 
 3. Curry	0.134 
 4. Booker	0.152 
 5. Irving	0.154 
 6. Lillard	0.162 
 7. Williamson	0.162 
 8. Embiid	0.163 
 9. Leonard	0.167 
 10. Fox	0.179 
 11. Sexton	0.179 
 12. Randle	0.183 
 13. Tatum	0.190 
 14. Mitchell	0.193 
 15. Jokic	0.195 
 16. Antetokounmpo	0.195 
 17. LaVine	0.201 
 18. Doncic	0.209 
 19. Ingram	0.217 
 20. Brown	0.260

&nbsp;

I'm on the home stretch.  I'm going to make a PB&J sandwich after this, and it's going to be awesome.

&nbsp;

**The reason why I love Trae Young is specifically this.  Yes, he's pretty inefficient, but the man makes up for it at the line.**  He is an elite Ft shooter, and he's massively consistent at being elite.  His consistency at the line is unparalleled, only having one game of below .667 this entire season (Steph had 4, Dame had 3, Kyrie had 2).  

&nbsp;

**Celtics fans, I don't hate your team, Jaylen Brown is just a weird guy.**  His consistency at the line isn't great, but he also hardly gets there on a night to night basis.  Jaylen had nine games this year where he didn't even get to the line at all.  He had two 0% games, which is double what Giannis, but he also had 20 perfect games.  He plays nothing like John Starks, but his consistency is very reminiscent of him.

## **Conclusions**
**If you take anything away from reading this, please understand that EVERYTHING in basketball is relational.** Someone's PPG doesn't matter, if you don't know the percentages behind it.  Someone's ORTG or DRTG means nothing if you don't know specific components of their game behind said rating (case in point, Robin Lopez once led the league in ORTG, look it up, 2013-2014 season).
&nbsp;


**Being consistent is neither good nor bad, without knowing someone's efficiency to begin with.**  Being consistently inefficient is bad, and being inconsistently good is also bad.  They are two wildly different metrics, but they also need each other in order to having any meaning at all.

&nbsp;

Anyone who says Giannis has no skill is being purely disingenuous at this point.","2021-12-07 11:04:49 AM","[Link to Giannis' stats](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/a/antetgi01.html)

&#x200B;

The only other contemporary volume scorer (i.e. not a low ppg center on offense) who has hit 80% from within 3ft over a season is KD, who hit 80.2% in 14/15 and 83.3% in 35 games this season. Jokic hit a career high of 75.2% this season, and is considered to have phenomenal touch. AD's best mark is 78.5%. Dwight even during his dominant >20ppg seasons never got above 75.6%. Embiid tops out around 73%, Zion this season was at 70.1%. Barkley is the one player I most wish we had accurate shot location data for, as I'm sure he was in the ballpark as well.   

&#x200B;

Basically if KD and possibly Barkley are your only contemporaries at a basketball skill (and even then you still have the lead), you are probably pretty highly skilled. This is totally aside from being such a smart and effective defensive player.

You count to ten when Giannis Antetokounmpo attempts a free throw. It is more likely going in when he launches it at 9 or 12

I was just wondering, why can't people count 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 to really throw him off? That would be absolutely devastating and brutal.

"nba","DollazOnMyHead-","The use of players who have not played the whole game, for one final possession.","2021-12-07 1:05:18 PM","Hello,


So last night England and Italy played in the European Championship final in football.
Italy came out victorious on penalties, after going down 1-0 early in the game, but equalising in the 62nd minute. Mainly due to England's lack of impetus to push for a second goal.

However the crux of my post is dealing with, as the title mentions, players, who have not played a minute all game, being played for one possession.

Picture it, 101-102 trailing team has the ball with 0.2 left in the 4th with sideline out of bounds. At times, we may see the opposing coach put in a player who is tall, to defend the rim and not allow for alley-oops. My question is, is this the correct coaching decision to make.

The reason the parable of England last night and the nba has been made in my post, is because, last night the game went to penalties, the England manager decided to bring on 2 players, whom are B+ penalty takers, in the last minute of the game. Neither player had a meaningful touch in regular time. No problem so far, right? However, these two players missed their penalties. My hypothesis is that players who have not had time to acclimatise to the game, get up to speed, feel the emotion and momentum, cannot have good positive impacts in single actions. Here is where the comparison is drawn to the nba, if I needed someone to block the rim, I wouldn't want to bring them in if they hadn't played a minute all gam, I'd feel as though they aren't with it. They need time to acclimatise.

I would love to hear people's thoughts on this?

P. S. I'm sure a game this year, maybe even in the playoffs, was decided due to a poor defensive play from a player who had not played the whole game?","t3_oiz7mb","https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/oiz7mb/the_use_of_players_who_have_not_played_the_whole/",0,19,"t1_h4yrwkc","2021-12-07 2:19:02 PM","Literally happened this year with Frank Ntilikina in the playoffs",2,0,1,0,0,1.5

It just makes sense In a lot of ways it didn't come from the NBA instead the other way around. The vast majority of basketball isn't played in the NBA, so it makes sense that a lot of the innovation ends up happening elsewhere.  Nick Nurse and Mike D'Antoni came up with their unusual styles in Europe, a lot of pace and space started in low level college programmes, and the women's game has been hoisting a lot of 3s in recent years As for some of those other things, it depends more. In college it's less likely that you have multiple athletic wings, so switching is harder, and it's harder to find a big with NBA size and ability so often if you have one they will be featured more prominently. Simply because there's a strong chance that the other team doesn't have a player like that In the women's game, size is a bigger advantage than in the men's game. Due to the decreased physical athleticism and speed, it's simply harder to make up for size. A lot more of the game is played through the post, and while many of the women's games best players are guards, it's comparatively harder for them to attack bigs and the offensive shift to perimeter creation has been less drastic The international game is mixed. They often play more through their bigs, partially due to the same reasons above of not having the same athletes on the perimeter, fewer high quality bigs with size, and more physicality on the perimeter. But international play has also long been ahead of the NBA, spread pick and roll was the normal overseas long before the NBA. They often play with a smaller more athletic 5, or a skilled 5 simply because that's what was available and that's what a lot of overseas leagues create",32,0.036,0.875,0.089,0.9418,5.89

\---

There was a podcast episode last year when J.J. Redick and Damian Lillard talked about how Chris Paul is one of the few guys in the league who ""try to manipulate every single play"":

https://reddit.com/link/oiw9vx/video/ryt49bj4ita71/player

And it's true. CP is a master of finding advantages - whether it be a matchup, an angle on a screen-and-roll, a foul call - whatever he can or has to do to get one, he'll probably do it.

This is most obvious when he's hunting for matchups. In this Suns-Bucks series, that's usually Brook Lopez or Bobby Portis - two guys that struggle to defend pick-and-rolls in space.

Here's a possession from Game 3 last night where Chris calls for multiple screens in attempt to get Brook involved:

https://reddit.com/link/oiw9vx/video/a633e9a9ita71/player

Brilliant play from both the Suns and the Bucks here; it's an \~18 second chess match. Let's break it down:

1. Phoenix pushes the ball up in transition and the Bucks are crossmatched. Brook is left picking up Chris Paul. Brook and Jrue Holiday quickly scram switch before the ball finds Chris.
2. Chris catches the ball with 15 seconds on the shot clock. Milwaukee is now matched up properly: Jrue on CP, Giannis on Jae Crowder, Brook on Cam Johnson.
3. Chris obviously doesn't want Jrue on him; Crowder gives him a screen to switch Giannis Antetokounmpo onto him, then sprints to the corner to get Brook's man (Johnson) to come up for another screen.
4. Jrue and Brook sniff out what Phoenix is trying to do, so they scram switch again. On Johnson's screen, Chris is immediately picked back up by Holiday. No good.
5. But now Cam clears and takes Giannis with him. That isolates Jrue and Brook on one side of the floor, and Chris immediately attacks it. He and Jae run a little pitch/slip screen/pop.
6. Jrue has to stick with Chris because they don't want Brook isolated on him, Brook has to drop at first to prevent the drive, and it allows Crowder to get open for a wide open 3. Splash.

If you're counting, that's three screens and four switches in just nine seconds. Milwaukee did about as well as they could, but Chris Paul and the Suns were simply a little bit better.

\---

Another cool moment from G3:

The Suns' ball movement on display once again...

https://reddit.com/link/oiw9vx/video/dhnht5inita71/player

On the very next possession, as the Suns were about to go swing swing swing around the perimeter again, Giannis said ""hell no"" to that and rotated to the passing lane instead of to the shooter:

https://reddit.com/link/oiw9vx/video/jbrlwghqita71/player

It looks bad if you isolate it, but it was probably a smart move making Cameron Payne attempt an off-the-dribble 3 off of a pass fake instead of letting Crowder shoot another catch-and-shoot 3 from the spot he had just made one from.

If you're a stat-head like me, you likely spend a lot of time looking at every chart for a given player on Basketball Reference (or insert your stat site of choice).  There is a lot of powerful information in available metrics (especially adjusted shooting), but the one area where stats seem a bit deficient, is **quantifying ""consistency"" and ""efficiency""**.  
 
&nbsp;

Player ""X"" may average 25ppg on 55% Fg and 40% 3Pt, but that doesn't tell you anything about the spread of data.  Basically, it's difficult to look at a cumulative stat sheet for a player, and derive how often that 25ppg/55% Fg/40% 3Pt player shows up each night.  The lack of a consistency metric leads to a lot of speculative opinions about players; ""Player 'X' is good, but he's streaky and has a lot of hot and cold nights.""  Without watching every single game for Player ""X"", or looking at the entire gamelog for a season, it's difficult to have a response to said speculation, without you speculating as well, leading to *an ouroboros of speculation*.  
  
&nbsp;

This morning, I sat down, and went through the entire season of gamelogs for each of the top 20 scorers in the NBA, to provide both myself, as well as you all, with a little bit of clarity on how consistent, and efficient each of those players are.  

&nbsp;

# **Understandings (please read this)**  
There are two very important understandings that must be had, when looking at this data.  They are:

 * Nightly Average Shooting %
 * Standard Deviation (or StDev)

&nbsp;

## **Nightly Average Shooting %**

While this is the ""less complicated"" of the two, I am covering this one first, because I know this one will cause the most confusion.  

&nbsp;

The shooting percentages you see on a stat sheet, are an *average of cumulative metrics*.  The shooting percentages you will see in my tables, do not take this into consideration, because an average of all shots for an entire season doesn't tell you anything about consistency.

&nbsp;

 **Example**
For this example, lets take an imaginary 7 game series (to make this as simple as possible).  In this scenario, lets say Steph Curry had 3Pt shooting nights of:

* 10/10  
* 10/10  
* 0/5  
* 0/2  
* 0/3  
* 0/4  
* 0/5 

&nbsp;

Steph's 3pt shooting percentage of this series would be 20/39, or 51.28%.  If you just looked at that 51.28%, you would think ""*How did the Warriors lose?  Steph shot over 50% from 3!*""  The actual truth would be that **for over half the series, Steph shot very poorly**, he had 2 great games, and 5 bad games.  His **Nightly Average 3pt%** would be 28.57% ( much lower than his series 3Pt% of 51.28%). 

&nbsp; 

## **Standard Deviation (StDev)**  
  
This one is going to be a bit rough, and I'm going to keep it as simple as possible.  Professional data scientists, actual statisticians, and people that are REALLY deep into ""*stonks*"" will know what this is without having to read this section.  
  
&nbsp;

Here is a very layman's explanation of StDev and what you need to know:  
  
 1. StDev is the measurement of volatility of a data set.  Basically, how spread the data is.  
 2. **LOWER IS ALWAYS BETTER when consistency is a concern**  
 3. It's a bit more complicated than this, and without boring you with a lot of math, if you're curious on how StDev works, there are some great YouTube videos that describe it in a very digestible/visual way.  There is no shame in watching them, because even I had to do it, 5 years ago, when I first started using StDev as a method to evaluate data in my primary hobby, astrophotography.  
&nbsp;

## **The Actual Data!**  

*Note 1: This data is sorted by actual PPG, I will have breakdowns of each section below the table*  
*Note 2: Bold means ""leader among the Top 20""*  
*Note 3: Italics means ""worst among the Top 20""*

This list doesn't need a lot of analysis, you can get this list directly from Basketball Reference.  You don't/shouldn't need anyone to break down PPG for you.  If PPG were a TV show, it would be ""The Office"", because everyone can understand it, and everyone quotes it.

&nbsp;

I guess all of the ""robotic"" jokes about Kawhi Leonard have some statistical basis.  **Out of all of the top 20 scorers, Kawhi had the greatest chance of bringing every point of that 24.8 PPG to the table each game.**  His season high was 36 points, and his low was 13 points.

&nbsp;

Curry, well, when you carry a team that hard, I guess there will be a lot of fluctuation in your points output.  **His season average was 31.98 (basically 32), and he had 29 games of sub-average performance, and three games where he didn't even score half of his season average.**  His season high was 62 points (18 ft, 8 threes, and 18 buckets overall), and his season low was 11 (2 of 16 shooting for that game). 

## **Nightly Fg% (Average)**

 1. Williamson	0.621 
 2. Jokic	0.576 
 3. Antetokounmpo	0.574 
 4. Leonard	0.521

 17. Randle	0.452 
 18. Lillard	0.449 
 19. Mitchell	0.443 
 20. Young	0.432

&nbsp;

I doubt there is much surprise about the top, or the bottom of this list.  Zion is a dunk machine, almost 70% of his shots take place 0-3 feet from the basket, and nobody is going to stop his 284 lbs of fury.  **Ben Simmons, passing out of a wide open dunk, needs to watch some Zion footage.**

&nbsp;

The bottom of this list features two heavy volume shooters in Donovan Mitchell and Trae Young.  While 44% nightly field goal percentage isn't ""bad"", it's not great.  If you look at a lot of Hawks and/or Jazz box scores, you probably already had an inkling that neither of these two folks have an overwhelming amount of efficient nights.  **Mitchell had 10 nights this season where he shot worse than 35%, and Trae said ""*hold my beer*"" with 17 of his own nights (this is over 1/4th of his entire games played this season).**  Mitchell and Young are, at the very minimum, average in their TS+ (Trae being 103 and Mitchell being exactly league average at 100, though his actual TS is below league average .569 to .572), but both definitely struggle with consistent efficiency.

## **FG% (StDev)**

 1. Doncic	0.090 
 2. Leonard	0.098 
 3. Booker	0.101 
 4. Sexton	0.106 
 5. Beal	0.109 
 6. Lillard	0.109

 17. Young	0.130 
 18. Embiid	0.131 
 19. Williamson	0.133 
 20. Brown	0.134

&nbsp;

The top two, and bottom two, tell interesting stories.  Being ""consistent"" isn't always good, but it's also not always bad, it's all about context.  If you're a 25% shooter, you WANT your consistency to be way off, because you don't want to show up, every single night, and give 25% to your team.  **Luka leads the pack here, but it's not as good as Kawhi's efficiency, because Luka is extremely consistent at being averagely efficient (when compared to the top 20 here, as his average nightly Fg% is in the bottom half of this pack).**  Kawhi is in the top 5 for average nightly Fg%, as well as being 2nd on the list of standard deviation among his Fg% data.

&nbsp;

The bottom two, well ""*The Lord giveth, and the Lord taketh away*"".  Zion is, by far, the most efficient on a night by night basis, but due to the fact that his nightly Fg% is so absurdly high, he's going to have a decent amount of games where his Fg% is in the range of mere mortals.  **Zion had an impressive 10 games this season where he shot over 75%, but he also had 31 games this season where he shot below his nightly Fg% (though only 3 games where he was below 45%!).** 

&nbsp;

The Jaylen Brown stats are not that bad, hold those downvotes Celtics fans.  Yes, he's wildly inconsistent when compared to everyone else in this top 20, BUT, he's inconsistent on the good side.  He's 8th in his nightly Fg%, .490, pretty good.  **He had 29 games this season (over half his entire season) where he shot above that mark of .490, including an 85% night (17/20 shooting).**. Yeah, he's a bit erratic, but over half the time when he steps on the court, you're getting the ""*good*"" type of erratic; The type of erratic that John Starks fans loved.

## **Nightly 3pt% (Average)**

 1. Embiid	0.428 
 2. Curry	0.412 
 3. Randle	0.406 
 4. LaVine	0.404 
 5. Mitchell	0.398

&nbsp;

Ok, so yeah... This data set features the least practicable thing I thought I would see today, and the most predictable thing I would see today.  **When I started off this morning (7 hours ago from the moment I am typing this), I did NOT expect to see that Joel Embiid was going to be the most efficient 3Pt shooter out of the entire top 20 scorers in the league (on a night by night basis).** I will explain how this works in the next breakdown, where I talk about 3Pt% StDev.  Worry not Warriors fans, Steph is still the premiere ""*God Tier*"" 3Pt shooter in the league.

&nbsp;

*Exhales...* Let me begin this by saying that I'm a 30+ year Suns fan.  I pre-date the Barkley trade, and have been with them through all of the good, and all of the bad.  When I was stationed in Europe, I would stay up at crazy hours, just so I could root for the Purple and Orange.  I went to games at the Madhouse on McDowell.  With that out of the way: Devin Booker is a very inefficient 3Pt shooter.  As you've seen in the last game (assuming I get this out before this evening's game), he's not a ""*bad*"" 3Pt shooter (he hit a few HUGE threes), but he is rather inefficient on a night-to-night basis.  You don't even have to watch Suns games to understand this either, you can look at the box scores.  **The league average (this season) was .367 from 3, wanna guess how many games Devin spent below the league average?**  39 games (58% of the games he played this season), including 10 games where he was 0% from 3.  

## **3Pt% (StDev)**

 1. Lillard	0.151 
 2. Curry	0.158 
 3. Tatum	0.180 
 4. Doncic	0.188 
 5. LaVine	0.193 
 6. Fox	0.196 
 7. Brown	0.196 
 8. Ingram	0.200 
 9. Mitchell	0.201 
 10. Booker	0.207 
 11. Beal	0.219 
 12. Young	0.221 
 13. Irving	0.223 
 14. Leonard	0.257 
 15. Randle	0.258 
 16. Antetokounmpo	0.259 
 17. Sexton	0.273 
 18. Jokic	0.305 
 19. Embiid	0.337 
 20. Williamson	0.450

&nbsp;

Lets address the open item from the breakdown before this one.  **Embiid is not an elite 3Pt shooter, he just doesn't shoot a lot (for a 3Pt shooter) and he has a decent number (8 to be exact) of 100% nights (where he went 1/1 or 2/2).**   Yes, Book has 10 nights of 0%, but Embiid has 12 nights of the same percentage.  Roughly 24% of the time Joel steps onto the court, he's going to be a complete dud from 3.

&nbsp;

**Steph is still the gold standard when it comes to 3Pt shooting.**  Lillard is on top of this list, meaning that he's the most consistent, but all that means is that he's the most consistent at bringing home a nightly 3Pt% lower than Steph (8% lower, relatively).  Props to Dame, but Curry is the King, all Hail to the Chef.

## **Nightly Ft% (Average)**

 1. Irving	0.923 
 2. Curry	0.914 
 3. Lillard	0.906 
 4. Young	0.891 
 5. Leonard	0.885 
 6. Beal	0.883 
 7. Booker	0.865 
 8. Tatum	0.864 
 9. Ingram	0.860 
 10. LaVine	0.859 
 11. Jokic	0.857 
 12. Embiid	0.849 
 13. Mitchell	0.827 
 14. Sexton	0.816 
 15. Randle	0.803 
 16. Brown	0.770 
 17. Doncic	0.728 
 18. Williamson	0.707 
 19. Fox	0.705 
 20. Antetokounmpo	0.683

&nbsp;

Well, it was nice knowing you.  This is likely where everyone checks out, if you haven't checked out already (lets be real, this is a wall of text after all).  Not many folks are going to care about Ft%, except for the diehard stat-heads.

&nbsp;

**Kyrie had a 50/40/90 season (and 36 perfect games), Steph is on the same level as Steve Nash when it comes to free throws (he had 36 as well), and Dame is an elite-level free throw shooter as well (38 perfect games for Dolla).**  Not many surprises here.

&nbsp;

**And coming in at the bottom, the Balkan Brick himself, Giannis.**  To be honest though, it's not nearly as bad as I thought it would be, and he only had 1 game of 0% all year

## **FT% (StDev)**

 1. Young	0.116 
 2. Beal	0.131 
 3. Curry	0.134 
 4. Booker	0.152 
 5. Irving	0.154 
 6. Lillard	0.162 
 7. Williamson	0.162 
 8. Embiid	0.163 
 9. Leonard	0.167 
 10. Fox	0.179 
 11. Sexton	0.179 
 12. Randle	0.183 
 13. Tatum	0.190 
 14. Mitchell	0.193 
 15. Jokic	0.195 
 16. Antetokounmpo	0.195 
 17. LaVine	0.201 
 18. Doncic	0.209 
 19. Ingram	0.217 
 20. Brown	0.260

&nbsp;

I'm on the home stretch.  I'm going to make a PB&J sandwich after this, and it's going to be awesome.

&nbsp;

**The reason why I love Trae Young is specifically this.  Yes, he's pretty inefficient, but the man makes up for it at the line.**  He is an elite Ft shooter, and he's massively consistent at being elite.  His consistency at the line is unparalleled, only having one game of below .667 this entire season (Steph had 4, Dame had 3, Kyrie had 2).  

&nbsp;

**Celtics fans, I don't hate your team, Jaylen Brown is just a weird guy.**  His consistency at the line isn't great, but he also hardly gets there on a night to night basis.  Jaylen had nine games this year where he didn't even get to the line at all.  He had two 0% games, which is double what Giannis, but he also had 20 perfect games.  He plays nothing like John Starks, but his consistency is very reminiscent of him.

## **Conclusions**
**If you take anything away from reading this, please understand that EVERYTHING in basketball is relational.** Someone's PPG doesn't matter, if you don't know the percentages behind it.  Someone's ORTG or DRTG means nothing if you don't know specific components of their game behind said rating (case in point, Robin Lopez once led the league in ORTG, look it up, 2013-2014 season).
&nbsp;


**Being consistent is neither good nor bad, without knowing someone's efficiency to begin with.**  Being consistently inefficient is bad, and being inconsistently good is also bad.  They are two wildly different metrics, but they also need each other in order to having any meaning at all.

&nbsp;

I hope you enjoyed my Ted Talk.  Thank you for reading this.

Here’s the comment:

Klay Thompson is one of the more overrated players of his generation, max player held to role player expectations who people only recognize when he plays well and ignore all the times he doesnt which creates false reputations like him being some ""playoff assassin!!"". Lives off that one game in OKC 5 yrs ago and when he does stuff like throw away playoff games it's just blame Steph/KD instead. 38% 3 point shooter in the Steve Kerr era when Steph isnt on the floor. He was never actually an All NBA level player.

It’s like everyone wants a hot take like little mini versions of Stephen A & Skip Bayless. Klay is the perfect number 2 option. He doesn’t need the ball nor does he hold onto the ball. He’s an excellent perimeter defender, always defended the opposing team’s best guards/wings. Arguably the second best shooter of all time behind his own teammate, has the best hot streaks in the history of the league. How many second options can get 60? How about hitting 14 threes? Go 9/9 from three in a quarter? 37 points in a quarter! Y’all can’t even do that on 2k lol but he’s overrated? The only challenge in terms of pure shooting to Steph. Of course people didn’t hold him accountable when your role shrinks because another MVP joins your team you’ll have less opportunities. His presence alone stretches the floor for a Draymond/other role players to be at their best. Y’all forget how great players are because of injuries.",140,0.042,0.762,0.196,0.9807,6.96

Robert Williams is 24th overall in NBA.com's PIE metric. The players around him are effectively a list of the all-NBA teams and Boban. He ranks 3rd in Win Shares Per 48 minutes, right behind Nikola Jokic and Joel Embiid.  Rob Williams averaged 8-7-2 in 52 games last year. 


It's safe to say Robert Williams has an outsized impact when he's actually on the court, which unfortunately can be a rarity.  If you told me we'd get 70 healthy games out of Rob next season, and a healthy playoffs, I would be convinced the Cs would be making some serious noise. He may not score in bunches, but when he's at his best, he does pretty much everything else. 



The Celtics haven't really had a player like Rob during my fandom. They've had hyper athletic role players before, but none with the size and force of Rob (shout out Gerald Green and young Tony Allen, dude was a maniac). There's a natural anticipation when Rob is on the court. When he goes up for an oop sometimes it feels like he's going to fly right over the backboard, out of the stadium, and land right in line for a slice at Halftime Pizza. 



There's no doubt Rob is exciting, but exciting doesn't mean productive. The stats I just referenced seem to indicate he's one of the best players in the league. That's probably not the case, although it's incredibly tempting to make that argument. With those ridiculous stats in mind, let's try and figure out exactly how good our Timelord and savior is at basketball. 



**Dunking and Diming**



Rob's offense is truly unique. He's got extreme strengths and serious limitations. He's an excellent play finisher at the rim, but he's also a plus passer, and not just for a big.  That's a combo that doesn't come together very often, and it's the reason Rob has a chance to be special.  Once I take a look at those skills though, I'll walk through some of Rob's weaknesses. 



*Finish Him*



Rob Williams missed his calling as a wide receiver. I have never seen a center go up and get the ball like Rob Will can. He catches everything, and somehow usually manages [to finish without even landing](https://youtu.be/5s-oPirTfug?t=42). I mean look at that play! He catches it back shoulder, lefty, at the side of the hoop and finishes it all in one beautiful motion.  At some point, I think the guys were intentionally making it [hard on Rob](https://youtu.be/D9_TP3aRjLs?t=358). I mean look at that bullshit pass from Pritchard. He just kinda one hands it over Zubac even though Zubac didn't leave Rob! He's still guarding him and Rob just Randy Moss's right over and finishes it while hanging in the air seemingly forever. 



The stats bear out that Rob finishes everything remotely near the hoop. 




Stat  |  Numby  
:-:|:-:
RA FG% | 78% 
Paint Non-RA FG% | 69% 
Mid Range FG% | 34.8% 
Roll Man PPP | 1.23  
Roll Man %tile | 74th 
Post Up PPP | .93 
Post Up %tile | 46th



Dude misses 1 out of every 5 shots in the restricted area. Compare that with TT who shot a blistering (as in with herpes not temperature) 57% on shots in the RA (below average for a guard never mind a center). He's also excellent from floater range making almost 70% of his shots in the paint, but outside the RA.  



Part of the reason he's so efficient? 100 out of his 258 total FGAs were dunks (shot 93% on dunks... so apparently he missed 7). That makes Rob [fun as fuck to watch](https://youtu.be/D9_TP3aRjLs?t=371), but he doesn't have the most diverse offensive skillset (more on that in a bit).  He's not quite an elite roll man, partially because he's not a good FT shooter, and partially because he's not efficient from mid-range so he can't keep the defense honest. He also can't take a few dribbles and get to the rim if he has to catch it on the short roll. That said, if Rob has a lane to the hoop, or he gets the ball in the paint, it's probably going in the cup.  



He's not just a dunker though. He's had some seriously [nice patient finishes](https://youtu.be/uaRP_V5eZqo?t=45).  While his post up numbers aren't great, and he only posted up 14 times all season, I think as he bulks up and ages his athleticism and soft touch indicate he will probably become more efficient down there. It would open up other parts of Rob's game if he could be a consistent post threat, most notably, his passing. 



*Dime Lord*



Rob Williams is bordering on an elite passing big man. He has every pass in his bag. He's on time and accurate from the [top of the key](https://youtu.be/D9_TP3aRjLs?t=264), where he utilizes [different](https://youtu.be/D9_TP3aRjLs?t=336) types [of passes](https://youtu.be/oGUBAeh4dSk?t=93) to hit cutters on a dime or open shooters. While he's not real comfortable catching, dribbling, and playmaking on the short roll, if a pass is there, [he will make it](https://youtu.be/D9_TP3aRjLs?t=124). 


Rob's raw passing stats aren't amazing. 


Stat  |  Numby  
:-:|:-:
Ast% | 13.7% 
Pass to Ast% | 9.3% 
Ast. | 1.8 
Pot. Ast. | 2.7  



What gets really interesting is when we look at how the Cs play when Rob is ON the court versus when he's OFF. 



Stat  |  ON  |  OFF | Diff.
:-:|:-:|:-: |:-:
FG% | 48.2 | 46.0 | 2.2
TS% | 58.7 | 57.0 | 1.7
Ast % | 59.9 | 55.5 | 4.4
%FGs from 3 | 41.6 | 40.6 | 1.0
% 3s Assisted | 78.3 | 73.0 | 5.3




The Celtics are more efficient, they pass better, and they shoot more threes with Rob Will on the court, despite him taking 2 threes this year (both were full court heaves and he shot 0%).  Rob's knack for moving the ball quickly is conducive to good offense. Even simple stuff like [these little](https://youtu.be/oGUBAeh4dSk?t=73) flips (there are two right in a row in that video) and [lefty pitches to the corner](https://youtu.be/N0ULY5VJWQE?t=19) keep the defense off balance.  Rob just looks so natural moving hard one way and quickly flicking it to a cutting guard. That's more difficult than it looks and is much more useful than the standstill, statuesque handoffs a guy like TT does. Rob's guy is actively going the opposite direction, which makes help defense much more difficult once the ball is given up. Look at how much space Rob creates for Kemba after that second flip by rolling to the rim. I mean that is a WIDE open 3, and all Rob had to do was flip the ball and start jogging at the rim. That's how much attention he garners. 



Where things get really interesting is looking at Rob's numbers after the trade deadline, once he was moved into the starting lineup. Rob played 15 games after the deadline, the Celtics went 11-4 in those games, that's not a coincidence.  



Stat  |  ON  |  OFF | Diff.
:-:|:-:|:-: |:-:
FG% | 48.1 | 45.4 | 2.7
TS% | 60.0 | 56.9 | 3.1
Ast % | 63.8! | 57.2 | 6.6
%FGs from 3 | 46.8 | 44.4 | 2.4
% 3s Assisted | 85.1 | 78.1 | 7.0 
Net Rating | 9.1 | .7 | 8.4 



Excuse me, I need a shower and a cigarette. 63.8 Ast% when Rob was on the court after the deadline. That's the difference between a top 5 passing team and a bottom 10 passing team. Rob himself upped his Ast% to 17.2 and increased his assists and potential assists to 3 and 3.7 during that stretch.  



The Cs outscored teams by 9 points per 100 possessions with Rob on the court and only .7 with him off. The Celtics aren't just a better team when Rob is on the court, they go from middling to elite. 



Rob's combination of being both a high flying lob threat and a plus passer opens things up for the offense in a ton of ways. Sometimes he even [combines the two on a single play](https://youtu.be/5s-oPirTfug?t=29). He draws attention on his rolls which opens up corner shooters. He hits guys on backdoor cuts when defenders cheat high against the dribble handoff. Rob makes teams play honest, and if they don't, he punishes them. He has the ability to fundamentally alter the Celtics' ceiling, and there's only two other guys on the team you can say that about. 



**He's not Perfect**



With all that said, Rob has some serious on-court offensive weaknesses that limit exactly how good he can be right now.  


First of all, he basically does not dribble. Rob averages an unbelievable .41 dribbles per touch. That doesn't even make sense to me, it's like he's not even playing basketball. If those cutters aren't open, or the initial pick and roll isn't effective, Rob doesn't bring a ton else to the table other than standing in the dunker spot.  If he gets the ball at the elbow extended, he's basically out of moves unless you think a 35% mid range jumper is a good possession (it's not).  



His lack of range is limiting his offensive upside right now. 191 of his 258 shots were taken in the restricted area and 74% of his makes were assisted (a significant portion of the unassisted are off put backs).  He cannot create his own shot at all when facing up, and Stevens clearly didn't trust him to post up since he only did it 14 times.  His inability to do basically anything with the ball in his hands limits how effective he can be as a passer and playmaker.  Rob is a great passer, he's accurate and has good vision, but he can't manipulate a defense to create passing opportunities like even Bam can (and forget about Jokic, dude is on another level).  He's also somewhat turnover prone, leading the Celtics bigs in TOs per 100 possessions (non-Mo Wagner division) with 2.5. It's not real concerning now, but it's something to monitor as Rob (hopefully) takes up a larger role offensively for the Cs. 



All tolled, Rob Williams is already an elite role player on offense.  The lack of a similar skillset on the Cs, combined with the Celtics having to play TT when Rob didn't play, make his ON OFFs look amazing, but that's more than noise. Rob has the ability to turn from elite role player to tertiary star if he adds a few things to his game. Unfortunately, all of that requires him to stay healthy, and that is the real question mark with Williams. At this point, his impact may not be all-star level despite what some impact metrics say, but if he stays on the court, there's a very good chance it will get there.","t3_oivok4","https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/oivok4/oc_i_want_the_whole_lord_a_look_at_rob_williams/",120,23,"t1_h4y21wj","2021-12-07 10:58:39 AM","I didn't know I needed to wake up to this today",4,0,1,0,0,1.5

"nba","Interesting_Ad_8188","The use of players who have not played the whole game, for one final possession.","2021-12-07 1:05:18 PM","Hello,


So last night England and Italy played in the European Championship final in football.
Italy came out victorious on penalties, after going down 1-0 early in the game, but equalising in the 62nd minute. Mainly due to England's lack of impetus to push for a second goal.

However the crux of my post is dealing with, as the title mentions, players, who have not played a minute all game, being played for one possession.

Picture it, 101-102 trailing team has the ball with 0.2 left in the 4th with sideline out of bounds. At times, we may see the opposing coach put in a player who is tall, to defend the rim and not allow for alley-oops. My question is, is this the correct coaching decision to make.

The reason the parable of England last night and the nba has been made in my post, is because, last night the game went to penalties, the England manager decided to bring on 2 players, whom are B+ penalty takers, in the last minute of the game. Neither player had a meaningful touch in regular time. No problem so far, right? However, these two players missed their penalties. My hypothesis is that players who have not had time to acclimatise to the game, get up to speed, feel the emotion and momentum, cannot have good positive impacts in single actions. Here is where the comparison is drawn to the nba, if I needed someone to block the rim, I wouldn't want to bring them in if they hadn't played a minute all gam, I'd feel as though they aren't with it. They need time to acclimatise.

I would love to hear people's thoughts on this?

P. S. I'm sure a game this year, maybe even in the playoffs, was decided due to a poor defensive play from a player who had not played the whole game?","t3_oiz7mb","https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/oiz7mb/the_use_of_players_who_have_not_played_the_whole/",1,19,"t1_h4yiiz8","2021-12-07 1:07:42 PM","Happened with the knicks when they brought Frankie smokes in to guard Young",7,0,1,0,0,3

Robert Williams is 24th overall in NBA.com's PIE metric. The players around him are effectively a list of the all-NBA teams and Boban. He ranks 3rd in Win Shares Per 48 minutes, right behind Nikola Jokic and Joel Embiid.  Rob Williams averaged 8-7-2 in 52 games last year. 


It's safe to say Robert Williams has an outsized impact when he's actually on the court, which unfortunately can be a rarity.  If you told me we'd get 70 healthy games out of Rob next season, and a healthy playoffs, I would be convinced the Cs would be making some serious noise. He may not score in bunches, but when he's at his best, he does pretty much everything else. 



The Celtics haven't really had a player like Rob during my fandom. They've had hyper athletic role players before, but none with the size and force of Rob (shout out Gerald Green and young Tony Allen, dude was a maniac). There's a natural anticipation when Rob is on the court. When he goes up for an oop sometimes it feels like he's going to fly right over the backboard, out of the stadium, and land right in line for a slice at Halftime Pizza. 



There's no doubt Rob is exciting, but exciting doesn't mean productive. The stats I just referenced seem to indicate he's one of the best players in the league. That's probably not the case, although it's incredibly tempting to make that argument. With those ridiculous stats in mind, let's try and figure out exactly how good our Timelord and savior is at basketball. 



**Dunking and Diming**



Rob's offense is truly unique. He's got extreme strengths and serious limitations. He's an excellent play finisher at the rim, but he's also a plus passer, and not just for a big.  That's a combo that doesn't come together very often, and it's the reason Rob has a chance to be special.  Once I take a look at those skills though, I'll walk through some of Rob's weaknesses. 



*Finish Him*



Rob Williams missed his calling as a wide receiver. I have never seen a center go up and get the ball like Rob Will can. He catches everything, and somehow usually manages [to finish without even landing](https://youtu.be/5s-oPirTfug?t=42). I mean look at that play! He catches it back shoulder, lefty, at the side of the hoop and finishes it all in one beautiful motion.  At some point, I think the guys were intentionally making it [hard on Rob](https://youtu.be/D9_TP3aRjLs?t=358). I mean look at that bullshit pass from Pritchard. He just kinda one hands it over Zubac even though Zubac didn't leave Rob! He's still guarding him and Rob just Randy Moss's right over and finishes it while hanging in the air seemingly forever. 



The stats bear out that Rob finishes everything remotely near the hoop. 




Stat  |  Numby  
:-:|:-:
RA FG% | 78% 
Paint Non-RA FG% | 69% 
Mid Range FG% | 34.8% 
Roll Man PPP | 1.23  
Roll Man %tile | 74th 
Post Up PPP | .93 
Post Up %tile | 46th



Dude misses 1 out of every 5 shots in the restricted area. Compare that with TT who shot a blistering (as in with herpes not temperature) 57% on shots in the RA (below average for a guard never mind a center). He's also excellent from floater range making almost 70% of his shots in the paint, but outside the RA.  



Part of the reason he's so efficient? 100 out of his 258 total FGAs were dunks (shot 93% on dunks... so apparently he missed 7). That makes Rob [fun as fuck to watch](https://youtu.be/D9_TP3aRjLs?t=371), but he doesn't have the most diverse offensive skillset (more on that in a bit).  He's not quite an elite roll man, partially because he's not a good FT shooter, and partially because he's not efficient from mid-range so he can't keep the defense honest. He also can't take a few dribbles and get to the rim if he has to catch it on the short roll. That said, if Rob has a lane to the hoop, or he gets the ball in the paint, it's probably going in the cup.  



He's not just a dunker though. He's had some seriously [nice patient finishes](https://youtu.be/uaRP_V5eZqo?t=45).  While his post up numbers aren't great, and he only posted up 14 times all season, I think as he bulks up and ages his athleticism and soft touch indicate he will probably become more efficient down there. It would open up other parts of Rob's game if he could be a consistent post threat, most notably, his passing. 



*Dime Lord*



Rob Williams is bordering on an elite passing big man. He has every pass in his bag. He's on time and accurate from the [top of the key](https://youtu.be/D9_TP3aRjLs?t=264), where he utilizes [different](https://youtu.be/D9_TP3aRjLs?t=336) types [of passes](https://youtu.be/oGUBAeh4dSk?t=93) to hit cutters on a dime or open shooters. While he's not real comfortable catching, dribbling, and playmaking on the short roll, if a pass is there, [he will make it](https://youtu.be/D9_TP3aRjLs?t=124). 


Rob's raw passing stats aren't amazing. 


Stat  |  Numby  
:-:|:-:
Ast% | 13.7% 
Pass to Ast% | 9.3% 
Ast. | 1.8 
Pot. Ast. | 2.7  



What gets really interesting is when we look at how the Cs play when Rob is ON the court versus when he's OFF. 



Stat  |  ON  |  OFF | Diff.
:-:|:-:|:-: |:-:
FG% | 48.2 | 46.0 | 2.2
TS% | 58.7 | 57.0 | 1.7
Ast % | 59.9 | 55.5 | 4.4
%FGs from 3 | 41.6 | 40.6 | 1.0
% 3s Assisted | 78.3 | 73.0 | 5.3




The Celtics are more efficient, they pass better, and they shoot more threes with Rob Will on the court, despite him taking 2 threes this year (both were full court heaves and he shot 0%).  Rob's knack for moving the ball quickly is conducive to good offense. Even simple stuff like [these little](https://youtu.be/oGUBAeh4dSk?t=73) flips (there are two right in a row in that video) and [lefty pitches to the corner](https://youtu.be/N0ULY5VJWQE?t=19) keep the defense off balance.  Rob just looks so natural moving hard one way and quickly flicking it to a cutting guard. That's more difficult than it looks and is much more useful than the standstill, statuesque handoffs a guy like TT does. Rob's guy is actively going the opposite direction, which makes help defense much more difficult once the ball is given up. Look at how much space Rob creates for Kemba after that second flip by rolling to the rim. I mean that is a WIDE open 3, and all Rob had to do was flip the ball and start jogging at the rim. That's how much attention he garners. 



Where things get really interesting is looking at Rob's numbers after the trade deadline, once he was moved into the starting lineup. Rob played 15 games after the deadline, the Celtics went 11-4 in those games, that's not a coincidence.  



Stat  |  ON  |  OFF | Diff.
:-:|:-:|:-: |:-:
FG% | 48.1 | 45.4 | 2.7
TS% | 60.0 | 56.9 | 3.1
Ast % | 63.8! | 57.2 | 6.6
%FGs from 3 | 46.8 | 44.4 | 2.4
% 3s Assisted | 85.1 | 78.1 | 7.0 
Net Rating | 9.1 | .7 | 8.4 



Excuse me, I need a shower and a cigarette. 63.8 Ast% when Rob was on the court after the deadline. That's the difference between a top 5 passing team and a bottom 10 passing team. Rob himself upped his Ast% to 17.2 and increased his assists and potential assists to 3 and 3.7 during that stretch.  



The Cs outscored teams by 9 points per 100 possessions with Rob on the court and only .7 with him off. The Celtics aren't just a better team when Rob is on the court, they go from middling to elite. 



Rob's combination of being both a high flying lob threat and a plus passer opens things up for the offense in a ton of ways. Sometimes he even [combines the two on a single play](https://youtu.be/5s-oPirTfug?t=29). He draws attention on his rolls which opens up corner shooters. He hits guys on backdoor cuts when defenders cheat high against the dribble handoff. Rob makes teams play honest, and if they don't, he punishes them. He has the ability to fundamentally alter the Celtics' ceiling, and there's only two other guys on the team you can say that about. 



**He's not Perfect**



With all that said, Rob has some serious on-court offensive weaknesses that limit exactly how good he can be right now.  


First of all, he basically does not dribble. Rob averages an unbelievable .41 dribbles per touch. That doesn't even make sense to me, it's like he's not even playing basketball. If those cutters aren't open, or the initial pick and roll isn't effective, Rob doesn't bring a ton else to the table other than standing in the dunker spot.  If he gets the ball at the elbow extended, he's basically out of moves unless you think a 35% mid range jumper is a good possession (it's not).  



His lack of range is limiting his offensive upside right now. 191 of his 258 shots were taken in the restricted area and 74% of his makes were assisted (a significant portion of the unassisted are off put backs).  He cannot create his own shot at all when facing up, and Stevens clearly didn't trust him to post up since he only did it 14 times.  His inability to do basically anything with the ball in his hands limits how effective he can be as a passer and playmaker.  Rob is a great passer, he's accurate and has good vision, but he can't manipulate a defense to create passing opportunities like even Bam can (and forget about Jokic, dude is on another level).  He's also somewhat turnover prone, leading the Celtics bigs in TOs per 100 possessions (non-Mo Wagner division) with 2.5. It's not real concerning now, but it's something to monitor as Rob (hopefully) takes up a larger role offensively for the Cs. 



All tolled, Rob Williams is already an elite role player on offense.  The lack of a similar skillset on the Cs, combined with the Celtics having to play TT when Rob didn't play, make his ON OFFs look amazing, but that's more than noise. Rob has the ability to turn from elite role player to tertiary star if he adds a few things to his game. Unfortunately, all of that requires him to stay healthy, and that is the real question mark with Williams. At this point, his impact may not be all-star level despite what some impact metrics say, but if he stays on the court, there's a very good chance it will get there.","t3_oivok4","https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/oivok4/oc_i_want_the_whole_lord_a_look_at_rob_williams/",122,24,"t1_h4y21wj","2021-12-07 10:58:39 AM","I didn't know I needed to wake up to this today",5,0,1,0,0,1.5

Robert Williams is 24th overall in NBA.com's PIE metric. The players around him are effectively a list of the all-NBA teams and Boban. He ranks 3rd in Win Shares Per 48 minutes, right behind Nikola Jokic and Joel Embiid.  Rob Williams averaged 8-7-2 in 52 games last year. 


It's safe to say Robert Williams has an outsized impact when he's actually on the court, which unfortunately can be a rarity.  If you told me we'd get 70 healthy games out of Rob next season, and a healthy playoffs, I would be convinced the Cs would be making some serious noise. He may not score in bunches, but when he's at his best, he does pretty much everything else. 



The Celtics haven't really had a player like Rob during my fandom. They've had hyper athletic role players before, but none with the size and force of Rob (shout out Gerald Green and young Tony Allen, dude was a maniac). There's a natural anticipation when Rob is on the court. When he goes up for an oop sometimes it feels like he's going to fly right over the backboard, out of the stadium, and land right in line for a slice at Halftime Pizza. 



There's no doubt Rob is exciting, but exciting doesn't mean productive. The stats I just referenced seem to indicate he's one of the best players in the league. That's probably not the case, although it's incredibly tempting to make that argument. With those ridiculous stats in mind, let's try and figure out exactly how good our Timelord and savior is at basketball. 



**Dunking and Diming**



Rob's offense is truly unique. He's got extreme strengths and serious limitations. He's an excellent play finisher at the rim, but he's also a plus passer, and not just for a big.  That's a combo that doesn't come together very often, and it's the reason Rob has a chance to be special.  Once I take a look at those skills though, I'll walk through some of Rob's weaknesses. 



*Finish Him*



Rob Williams missed his calling as a wide receiver. I have never seen a center go up and get the ball like Rob Will can. He catches everything, and somehow usually manages [to finish without even landing](https://youtu.be/5s-oPirTfug?t=42). I mean look at that play! He catches it back shoulder, lefty, at the side of the hoop and finishes it all in one beautiful motion.  At some point, I think the guys were intentionally making it [hard on Rob](https://youtu.be/D9_TP3aRjLs?t=358). I mean look at that bullshit pass from Pritchard. He just kinda one hands it over Zubac even though Zubac didn't leave Rob! He's still guarding him and Rob just Randy Moss's right over and finishes it while hanging in the air seemingly forever. 



The stats bear out that Rob finishes everything remotely near the hoop. 




Stat  |  Numby  
:-:|:-:
RA FG% | 78% 
Paint Non-RA FG% | 69% 
Mid Range FG% | 34.8% 
Roll Man PPP | 1.23  
Roll Man %tile | 74th 
Post Up PPP | .93 
Post Up %tile | 46th



Dude misses 1 out of every 5 shots in the restricted area. Compare that with TT who shot a blistering (as in with herpes not temperature) 57% on shots in the RA (below average for a guard never mind a center). He's also excellent from floater range making almost 70% of his shots in the paint, but outside the RA.  



Part of the reason he's so efficient? 100 out of his 258 total FGAs were dunks (shot 93% on dunks... so apparently he missed 7). That makes Rob [fun as fuck to watch](https://youtu.be/D9_TP3aRjLs?t=371), but he doesn't have the most diverse offensive skillset (more on that in a bit).  He's not quite an elite roll man, partially because he's not a good FT shooter, and partially because he's not efficient from mid-range so he can't keep the defense honest. He also can't take a few dribbles and get to the rim if he has to catch it on the short roll. That said, if Rob has a lane to the hoop, or he gets the ball in the paint, it's probably going in the cup.  



He's not just a dunker though. He's had some seriously [nice patient finishes](https://youtu.be/uaRP_V5eZqo?t=45).  While his post up numbers aren't great, and he only posted up 14 times all season, I think as he bulks up and ages his athleticism and soft touch indicate he will probably become more efficient down there. It would open up other parts of Rob's game if he could be a consistent post threat, most notably, his passing. 



*Dime Lord*



Rob Williams is bordering on an elite passing big man. He has every pass in his bag. He's on time and accurate from the [top of the key](https://youtu.be/D9_TP3aRjLs?t=264), where he utilizes [different](https://youtu.be/D9_TP3aRjLs?t=336) types [of passes](https://youtu.be/oGUBAeh4dSk?t=93) to hit cutters on a dime or open shooters. While he's not real comfortable catching, dribbling, and playmaking on the short roll, if a pass is there, [he will make it](https://youtu.be/D9_TP3aRjLs?t=124). 


Rob's raw passing stats aren't amazing. 


Stat  |  Numby  
:-:|:-:
Ast% | 13.7% 
Pass to Ast% | 9.3% 
Ast. | 1.8 
Pot. Ast. | 2.7  



What gets really interesting is when we look at how the Cs play when Rob is ON the court versus when he's OFF. 



Stat  |  ON  |  OFF | Diff.
:-:|:-:|:-: |:-:
FG% | 48.2 | 46.0 | 2.2
TS% | 58.7 | 57.0 | 1.7
Ast % | 59.9 | 55.5 | 4.4
%FGs from 3 | 41.6 | 40.6 | 1.0
% 3s Assisted | 78.3 | 73.0 | 5.3




The Celtics are more efficient, they pass better, and they shoot more threes with Rob Will on the court, despite him taking 2 threes this year (both were full court heaves and he shot 0%).  Rob's knack for moving the ball quickly is conducive to good offense. Even simple stuff like [these little](https://youtu.be/oGUBAeh4dSk?t=73) flips (there are two right in a row in that video) and [lefty pitches to the corner](https://youtu.be/N0ULY5VJWQE?t=19) keep the defense off balance.  Rob just looks so natural moving hard one way and quickly flicking it to a cutting guard. That's more difficult than it looks and is much more useful than the standstill, statuesque handoffs a guy like TT does. Rob's guy is actively going the opposite direction, which makes help defense much more difficult once the ball is given up. Look at how much space Rob creates for Kemba after that second flip by rolling to the rim. I mean that is a WIDE open 3, and all Rob had to do was flip the ball and start jogging at the rim. That's how much attention he garners. 



Where things get really interesting is looking at Rob's numbers after the trade deadline, once he was moved into the starting lineup. Rob played 15 games after the deadline, the Celtics went 11-4 in those games, that's not a coincidence.  



Stat  |  ON  |  OFF | Diff.
:-:|:-:|:-: |:-:
FG% | 48.1 | 45.4 | 2.7
TS% | 60.0 | 56.9 | 3.1
Ast % | 63.8! | 57.2 | 6.6
%FGs from 3 | 46.8 | 44.4 | 2.4
% 3s Assisted | 85.1 | 78.1 | 7.0 
Net Rating | 9.1 | .7 | 8.4 



Excuse me, I need a shower and a cigarette. 63.8 Ast% when Rob was on the court after the deadline. That's the difference between a top 5 passing team and a bottom 10 passing team. Rob himself upped his Ast% to 17.2 and increased his assists and potential assists to 3 and 3.7 during that stretch.  



The Cs outscored teams by 9 points per 100 possessions with Rob on the court and only .7 with him off. The Celtics aren't just a better team when Rob is on the court, they go from middling to elite. 



Rob's combination of being both a high flying lob threat and a plus passer opens things up for the offense in a ton of ways. Sometimes he even [combines the two on a single play](https://youtu.be/5s-oPirTfug?t=29). He draws attention on his rolls which opens up corner shooters. He hits guys on backdoor cuts when defenders cheat high against the dribble handoff. Rob makes teams play honest, and if they don't, he punishes them. He has the ability to fundamentally alter the Celtics' ceiling, and there's only two other guys on the team you can say that about. 



**He's not Perfect**



With all that said, Rob has some serious on-court offensive weaknesses that limit exactly how good he can be right now.  


First of all, he basically does not dribble. Rob averages an unbelievable .41 dribbles per touch. That doesn't even make sense to me, it's like he's not even playing basketball. If those cutters aren't open, or the initial pick and roll isn't effective, Rob doesn't bring a ton else to the table other than standing in the dunker spot.  If he gets the ball at the elbow extended, he's basically out of moves unless you think a 35% mid range jumper is a good possession (it's not).  



His lack of range is limiting his offensive upside right now. 191 of his 258 shots were taken in the restricted area and 74% of his makes were assisted (a significant portion of the unassisted are off put backs).  He cannot create his own shot at all when facing up, and Stevens clearly didn't trust him to post up since he only did it 14 times.  His inability to do basically anything with the ball in his hands limits how effective he can be as a passer and playmaker.  Rob is a great passer, he's accurate and has good vision, but he can't manipulate a defense to create passing opportunities like even Bam can (and forget about Jokic, dude is on another level).  He's also somewhat turnover prone, leading the Celtics bigs in TOs per 100 possessions (non-Mo Wagner division) with 2.5. It's not real concerning now, but it's something to monitor as Rob (hopefully) takes up a larger role offensively for the Cs. 



All tolled, Rob Williams is already an elite role player on offense.  The lack of a similar skillset on the Cs, combined with the Celtics having to play TT when Rob didn't play, make his ON OFFs look amazing, but that's more than noise. Rob has the ability to turn from elite role player to tertiary star if he adds a few things to his game. Unfortunately, all of that requires him to stay healthy, and that is the real question mark with Williams. At this point, his impact may not be all-star level despite what some impact metrics say, but if he stays on the court, there's a very good chance it will get there.","t3_oivok4","https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/oivok4/oc_i_want_the_whole_lord_a_look_at_rob_williams/",125,24,"t1_h4xwh35","2021-12-07 10:17:23 AM","Robert Williams just does not deserve a 2-part post.",-36,0,1,0,0,1.5

Klay Thompson is one of the more overrated players of his generation, max player held to role player expectations who people only recognize when he plays well and ignore all the times he doesnt which creates false reputations like him being some ""playoff assassin!!"".

I wanted some Luka Doncic shoes, but he apparently does not have a signature shoe(Apparently that is a big deal and the best type of shoe?). I looked into some shoe stuff to try to understand. 

Luka signed a 5 year deal with Jordan brand in 2019. He has not gotten a signature shoe yet, apparently he needs to be regular season MVP or finals MVP to get a signature shoe. But Zion also signed with Jordan brand and got a signature shoe after only playing 24 total games in the NBA. LeBron has also said that he wanted make a team LeBron and to sign Luka as the first player.

This is where the question starts. Since Jordan brand has not given Luka a signature shoe, even though they gave Zion one when he has been less successful in the NBA in pretty much every way, can Luka leave early? Could Luka buy himself out of his deal, or is there any other way to end the 5 year deal early? Could LeBron buy the contract and sign him to a new deal or something? Could Nike just end it and resign with LeBron since both Jordan brand and team LeBron would be under Nike? I am saying LeBron because Luka likes him and LeBron wants Luka, but it could be someone else, I don't know?

I know Zion is good and popular, but Luka still not having a signature shoe after giving Zion one so easily seems disrespectful to Luka from Jordan brand.

Again I don't know anything about shoes, so if I am stupid please kindly let me know.","t3_oijzoz","https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/oijzoz/question_about_shoes_luka_lebron_and_jordan_brand/",15,82,"t1_h4wgtef","2021-12-07 2:04:44 AM","Zion had so much hype that he was probably going to get a shoe regardless of what he achieved in the nba that was just how hyped up he was to be.

"nba","RunThePnR","Consistency and Efficiency, a study of the top 20 scorers in the NBA this year","2021-11-07 2:32:46 PM","# **Preface**
If you're a stat-head like me, you likely spend a lot of time looking at every chart for a given player on Basketball Reference (or insert your stat site of choice).  There is a lot of powerful information in available metrics (especially adjusted shooting), but the one area where stats seem a bit deficient, is **quantifying ""consistency"" and ""efficiency""**.  
 
&nbsp;

Player ""X"" may average 25ppg on 55% Fg and 40% 3Pt, but that doesn't tell you anything about the spread of data.  Basically, it's difficult to look at a cumulative stat sheet for a player, and derive how often that 25ppg/55% Fg/40% 3Pt player shows up each night.  The lack of a consistency metric leads to a lot of speculative opinions about players; ""Player 'X' is good, but he's streaky and has a lot of hot and cold nights.""  Without watching every single game for Player ""X"", or looking at the entire gamelog for a season, it's difficult to have a response to said speculation, without you speculating as well, leading to *an ouroboros of speculation*.  
  
&nbsp;

This morning, I sat down, and went through the entire season of gamelogs for each of the top 20 scorers in the NBA, to provide both myself, as well as you all, with a little bit of clarity on how consistent, and efficient each of those players are.  

&nbsp;

# **Understandings (please read this)**  
There are two very important understandings that must be had, when looking at this data.  They are:

 * Nightly Average Shooting %
 * Standard Deviation (or StDev)

&nbsp;

## **Nightly Average Shooting %**

While this is the ""less complicated"" of the two, I am covering this one first, because I know this one will cause the most confusion.  

&nbsp;

The shooting percentages you see on a stat sheet, are an *average of cumulative metrics*.  The shooting percentages you will see in my tables, do not take this into consideration, because an average of all shots for an entire season doesn't tell you anything about consistency.

&nbsp;

 **Example**
For this example, lets take an imaginary 7 game series (to make this as simple as possible).  In this scenario, lets say Steph Curry had 3Pt shooting nights of:

* 10/10  
* 10/10  
* 0/5  
* 0/2  
* 0/3  
* 0/4  
* 0/5 

&nbsp;

Steph's 3pt shooting percentage of this series would be 20/39, or 51.28%.  If you just looked at that 51.28%, you would think ""*How did the Warriors lose?  Steph shot over 50% from 3!*""  The actual truth would be that **for over half the series, Steph shot very poorly**, he had 2 great games, and 5 bad games.  His **Nightly Average 3pt%** would be 28.57% ( much lower than his series 3Pt% of 51.28%). 

&nbsp; 

## **Standard Deviation (StDev)**  
  
This one is going to be a bit rough, and I'm going to keep it as simple as possible.  Professional data scientists, actual statisticians, and people that are REALLY deep into ""*stonks*"" will know what this is without having to read this section.  
  
&nbsp;

Here is a very layman's explanation of StDev and what you need to know:  
  
 1. StDev is the measurement of volatility of a data set.  Basically, how spread the data is.  
 2. **LOWER IS ALWAYS BETTER when consistency is a concern**  
 3. It's a bit more complicated than this, and without boring you with a lot of math, if you're curious on how StDev works, there are some great YouTube videos that describe it in a very digestible/visual way.  There is no shame in watching them, because even I had to do it, 5 years ago, when I first started using StDev as a method to evaluate data in my primary hobby, astrophotography.  
&nbsp;

## **The Actual Data!**  

*Note 1: This data is sorted by actual PPG, I will have breakdowns of each section below the table*  
*Note 2: Bold means ""leader among the Top 20""*  
*Note 3: Italics means ""worst among the Top 20""*

This list doesn't need a lot of analysis, you can get this list directly from Basketball Reference.  You don't/shouldn't need anyone to break down PPG for you.  If PPG were a TV show, it would be ""The Office"", because everyone can understand it, and everyone quotes it.

&nbsp;

I guess all of the ""robotic"" jokes about Kawhi Leonard have some statistical basis.  **Out of all of the top 20 scorers, Kawhi had the greatest chance of bringing every point of that 24.8 PPG to the table each game.**  His season high was 36 points, and his low was 13 points.

&nbsp;

Curry, well, when you carry a team that hard, I guess there will be a lot of fluctuation in your points output.  **His season average was 31.98 (basically 32), and he had 29 games of sub-average performance, and three games where he didn't even score half of his season average.**  His season high was 62 points (18 ft, 8 threes, and 18 buckets overall), and his season low was 11 (2 of 16 shooting for that game). 

## **Nightly Fg% (Average)**

 1. Williamson	0.621 
 2. Jokic	0.576 
 3. Antetokounmpo	0.574

 18. Lillard	0.449 
 19. Mitchell	0.443 
 20. Young	0.432

&nbsp;

I doubt there is much surprise about the top, or the bottom of this list.  Zion is a dunk machine, almost 70% of his shots take place 0-3 feet from the basket, and nobody is going to stop his 284 lbs of fury.  **Ben Simmons, passing out of a wide open dunk, needs to watch some Zion footage.**

&nbsp;

The bottom of this list features two heavy volume shooters in Donovan Mitchell and Trae Young.  While 44% nightly field goal percentage isn't ""bad"", it's not great.  If you look at a lot of Hawks and/or Jazz box scores, you probably already had an inkling that neither of these two folks have an overwhelming amount of efficient nights.  **Mitchell had 10 nights this season where he shot worse than 35%, and Trae said ""*hold my beer*"" with 17 of his own nights (this is over 1/4th of his entire games played this season).**  Mitchell and Young are, at the very minimum, average in their TS+ (Trae being 103 and Mitchell being exactly league average at 100, though his actual TS is below league average .569 to .572), but both definitely struggle with consistent efficiency.

## **FG% (StDev)**

 1. Doncic	0.090 
 2. Leonard	0.098 
 3. Booker	0.101 
 4. Sexton	0.106 
 5. Beal	0.109 
 6. Lillard	0.109 
 7. Fox	0.109 
 8. Curry	0.110 
 9. Randle	0.112 
 10. Jokic	0.113 
 11. Mitchell	0.114 
 12. Ingram	0.115

 14. Irving	0.117 
 15. Tatum	0.120 
 16. LaVine	0.126 
 17. Young	0.130 
 18. Embiid	0.131 
 19. Williamson	0.133 
 20. Brown	0.134

&nbsp;

The top two, and bottom two, tell interesting stories.  Being ""consistent"" isn't always good, but it's also not always bad, it's all about context.  If you're a 25% shooter, you WANT your consistency to be way off, because you don't want to show up, every single night, and give 25% to your team.  **Luka leads the pack here, but it's not as good as Kawhi's efficiency, because Luka is extremely consistent at being averagely efficient (when compared to the top 20 here, as his average nightly Fg% is in the bottom half of this pack).**  Kawhi is in the top 5 for average nightly Fg%, as well as being 2nd on the list of standard deviation among his Fg% data.

The bottom two, well ""*The Lord giveth, and the Lord taketh away*"".  Zion is, by far, the most efficient on a night by night basis, but due to the fact that his nightly Fg% is so absurdly high, he's going to have a decent amount of games where his Fg% is in the range of mere mortals.  **Zion had an impressive 10 games this season where he shot over 75%, but he also had 31 games this season where he shot below his nightly Fg% (though only 3 games where he was below 45%!).** 

&nbsp;

The Jaylen Brown stats are not that bad, hold those downvotes Celtics fans.  Yes, he's wildly inconsistent when compared to everyone else in this top 20, BUT, he's inconsistent on the good side.  He's 8th in his nightly Fg%, .490, pretty good.  **He had 29 games this season (over half his entire season) where he shot above that mark of .490, including an 85% night (17/20 shooting).**. Yeah, he's a bit erratic, but over half the time when he steps on the court, you're getting the ""*good*"" type of erratic; The type of erratic that John Starks fans loved.

## **Nightly 3pt% (Average)**

 2. Curry	0.412

&nbsp;

Ok, so yeah... This data set features the least practicable thing I thought I would see today, and the most predictable thing I would see today.  **When I started off this morning (7 hours ago from the moment I am typing this), I did NOT expect to see that Joel Embiid was going to be the most efficient 3Pt shooter out of the entire top 20 scorers in the league (on a night by night basis).** I will explain how this works in the next breakdown, where I talk about 3Pt% StDev.  Worry not Warriors fans, Steph is still the premiere ""*God Tier*"" 3Pt shooter in the league.

&nbsp;

*Exhales...* Let me begin this by saying that I'm a 30+ year Suns fan.  I pre-date the Barkley trade, and have been with them through all of the good, and all of the bad.  When I was stationed in Europe, I would stay up at crazy hours, just so I could root for the Purple and Orange.  I went to games at the Madhouse on McDowell.  With that out of the way: Devin Booker is a very inefficient 3Pt shooter.  As you've seen in the last game (assuming I get this out before this evening's game), he's not a ""*bad*"" 3Pt shooter (he hit a few HUGE threes), but he is rather inefficient on a night-to-night basis.  You don't even have to watch Suns games to understand this either, you can look at the box scores.  **The league average (this season) was .367 from 3, wanna guess how many games Devin spent below the league average?**  39 games (58% of the games he played this season), including 10 games where he was 0% from 3.  

## **3Pt% (StDev)**

 1. Lillard	0.151 
 2. Curry	0.158 
 3. Tatum	0.180 
 4. Doncic	0.188 
 5. LaVine	0.193 
 6. Fox	0.196 
 7. Brown	0.196 
 8. Ingram	0.200 
 9. Mitchell	0.201 
 10. Booker	0.207 
 11. Beal	0.219 
 12. Young	0.221 
 13. Irving	0.223 
 14. Leonard	0.257 
 15. Randle	0.258 
 16. Antetokounmpo	0.259 
 17. Sexton	0.273 
 18. Jokic	0.305 
 19. Embiid	0.337 
 20. Williamson	0.450

&nbsp;

Lets address the open item from the breakdown before this one.  **Embiid is not an elite 3Pt shooter, he just doesn't shoot a lot (for a 3Pt shooter) and he has a decent number (8 to be exact) of 100% nights (where he went 1/1 or 2/2).**   Yes, Book has 10 nights of 0%, but Embiid has 12 nights of the same percentage.  Roughly 24% of the time Joel steps onto the court, he's going to be a complete dud from 3.

&nbsp;

**Steph is still the gold standard when it comes to 3Pt shooting.**  Lillard is on top of this list, meaning that he's the most consistent, but all that means is that he's the most consistent at bringing home a nightly 3Pt% lower than Steph (8% lower, relatively).  Props to Dame, but Curry is the King, all Hail to the Chef.

## **Nightly Ft% (Average)**

 1. Irving	0.923 
 2. Curry	0.914 
 3. Lillard	0.906 
 4. Young	0.891 
 5. Leonard	0.885 
 6. Beal	0.883 
 7. Booker	0.865 
 8. Tatum	0.864 
 9. Ingram	0.860 
 10. LaVine	0.859 
 11. Jokic	0.857 
 12. Embiid	0.849 
 13. Mitchell	0.827 
 14. Sexton	0.816 
 15. Randle	0.803 
 16. Brown	0.770 
 17. Doncic	0.728 
 18. Williamson	0.707 
 19. Fox	0.705 
 20. Antetokounmpo	0.683

&nbsp;

Well, it was nice knowing you.  This is likely where everyone checks out, if you haven't checked out already (lets be real, this is a wall of text after all).  Not many folks are going to care about Ft%, except for the diehard stat-heads.

&nbsp;

**Kyrie had a 50/40/90 season (and 36 perfect games), Steph is on the same level as Steve Nash when it comes to free throws (he had 36 as well), and Dame is an elite-level free throw shooter as well (38 perfect games for Dolla).**  Not many surprises here.

&nbsp;

**And coming in at the bottom, the Balkan Brick himself, Giannis.**  To be honest though, it's not nearly as bad as I thought it would be, and he only had 1 game of 0% all year

## **FT% (StDev)**

 1. Young	0.116 
 2. Beal	0.131 
 3. Curry	0.134 
 4. Booker	0.152 
 5. Irving	0.154 
 6. Lillard	0.162 
 7. Williamson	0.162 
 8. Embiid	0.163 
 9. Leonard	0.167 
 10. Fox	0.179 
 11. Sexton	0.179 
 12. Randle	0.183 
 13. Tatum	0.190 
 14. Mitchell	0.193 
 15. Jokic	0.195 
 16. Antetokounmpo	0.195 
 17. LaVine	0.201 
 18. Doncic	0.209 
 19. Ingram	0.217 
 20. Brown	0.260

&nbsp;

I'm on the home stretch.  I'm going to make a PB&J sandwich after this, and it's going to be awesome.

&nbsp;

**The reason why I love Trae Young is specifically this.  Yes, he's pretty inefficient, but the man makes up for it at the line.**  He is an elite Ft shooter, and he's massively consistent at being elite.  His consistency at the line is unparalleled, only having one game of below .667 this entire season (Steph had 4, Dame had 3, Kyrie had 2).  

&nbsp;

**Celtics fans, I don't hate your team, Jaylen Brown is just a weird guy.**  His consistency at the line isn't great, but he also hardly gets there on a night to night basis.  Jaylen had nine games this year where he didn't even get to the line at all.  He had two 0% games, which is double what Giannis, but he also had 20 perfect games.  He plays nothing like John Starks, but his consistency is very reminiscent of him.

## **Conclusions**
**If you take anything away from reading this, please understand that EVERYTHING in basketball is relational.** Someone's PPG doesn't matter, if you don't know the percentages behind it.  Someone's ORTG or DRTG means nothing if you don't know specific components of their game behind said rating (case in point, Robin Lopez once led the league in ORTG, look it up, 2013-2014 season).
&nbsp;


**Being consistent is neither good nor bad, without knowing someone's efficiency to begin with.**  Being consistently inefficient is bad, and being inconsistently good is also bad.  They are two wildly different metrics, but they also need each other in order to having any meaning at all.

&nbsp;

I hope you enjoyed my Ted Talk.  Thank you for reading this.

If you're a stat-head like me, you likely spend a lot of time looking at every chart for a given player on Basketball Reference (or insert your stat site of choice).  There is a lot of powerful information in available metrics (especially adjusted shooting), but the one area where stats seem a bit deficient, is **quantifying ""consistency"" and ""efficiency""**.  
 
&nbsp;

Player ""X"" may average 25ppg on 55% Fg and 40% 3Pt, but that doesn't tell you anything about the spread of data.  Basically, it's difficult to look at a cumulative stat sheet for a player, and derive how often that 25ppg/55% Fg/40% 3Pt player shows up each night.  The lack of a consistency metric leads to a lot of speculative opinions about players; ""Player 'X' is good, but he's streaky and has a lot of hot and cold nights.""  Without watching every single game for Player ""X"", or looking at the entire gamelog for a season, it's difficult to have a response to said speculation, without you speculating as well, leading to *an ouroboros of speculation*.  
  
&nbsp;

This morning, I sat down, and went through the entire season of gamelogs for each of the top 20 scorers in the NBA, to provide both myself, as well as you all, with a little bit of clarity on how consistent, and efficient each of those players are.  

&nbsp;

# **Understandings (please read this)**  
There are two very important understandings that must be had, when looking at this data.  They are:

 * Nightly Average Shooting %
 * Standard Deviation (or StDev)

&nbsp;

## **Nightly Average Shooting %**

While this is the ""less complicated"" of the two, I am covering this one first, because I know this one will cause the most confusion.  

&nbsp;

The shooting percentages you see on a stat sheet, are an *average of cumulative metrics*.  The shooting percentages you will see in my tables, do not take this into consideration, because an average of all shots for an entire season doesn't tell you anything about consistency.

&nbsp;

 **Example**
For this example, lets take an imaginary 7 game series (to make this as simple as possible).  In this scenario, lets say Steph Curry had 3Pt shooting nights of:

* 10/10  
* 10/10  
* 0/5  
* 0/2  
* 0/3  
* 0/4  
* 0/5 

&nbsp;

Steph's 3pt shooting percentage of this series would be 20/39, or 51.28%.  If you just looked at that 51.28%, you would think ""*How did the Warriors lose?  Steph shot over 50% from 3!*""  The actual truth would be that **for over half the series, Steph shot very poorly**, he had 2 great games, and 5 bad games.  His **Nightly Average 3pt%** would be 28.57% ( much lower than his series 3Pt% of 51.28%). 

&nbsp; 

## **Standard Deviation (StDev)**  
  
This one is going to be a bit rough, and I'm going to keep it as simple as possible.  Professional data scientists, actual statisticians, and people that are REALLY deep into ""*stonks*"" will know what this is without having to read this section.  
  
&nbsp;

Here is a very layman's explanation of StDev and what you need to know:  
  
 1. StDev is the measurement of volatility of a data set.  Basically, how spread the data is.  
 2. **LOWER IS ALWAYS BETTER when consistency is a concern**  
 3. It's a bit more complicated than this, and without boring you with a lot of math, if you're curious on how StDev works, there are some great YouTube videos that describe it in a very digestible/visual way.  There is no shame in watching them, because even I had to do it, 5 years ago, when I first started using StDev as a method to evaluate data in my primary hobby, astrophotography.  
&nbsp;

## **The Actual Data!**  

*Note 1: This data is sorted by actual PPG, I will have breakdowns of each section below the table*  
*Note 2: Bold means ""leader among the Top 20""*  
*Note 3: Italics means ""worst among the Top 20""*

 18. Sexton	24.33  
 19. Randle	24.11  
 20. Ingram	23.77  
&nbsp;

This list doesn't need a lot of analysis, you can get this list directly from Basketball Reference.  You don't/shouldn't need anyone to break down PPG for you.  If PPG were a TV show, it would be ""The Office"", because everyone can understand it, and everyone quotes it.
  

## **Points Per Game (StDev)**

 1. Leonard	5.91 
 2. Ingram	5.98 
 3. Williamson	6.29 
 4. Sexton	6.32 
 5. Brown	7.05 
 6. Booker	7.52

 18. Tatum	9.39 
 19. Embiid	9.79 
 20. Curry	10.38

&nbsp;

I guess all of the ""robotic"" jokes about Kawhi Leonard have some statistical basis.  **Out of all of the top 20 scorers, Kawhi had the greatest chance of bringing every point of that 24.8 PPG to the table each game.**  His season high was 36 points, and his low was 13 points.

&nbsp;

Curry, well, when you carry a team that hard, I guess there will be a lot of fluctuation in your points output.  **His season average was 31.98 (basically 32), and he had 29 games of sub-average performance, and three games where he didn't even score half of his season average.**  His season high was 62 points (18 ft, 8 threes, and 18 buckets overall), and his season low was 11 (2 of 16 shooting for that game). 

## **Nightly Fg% (Average)**

 1. Williamson	0.621 
 2. Jokic	0.576 
 3. Antetokounmpo	0.574 
 4. Leonard	0.521 
 5. Embiid	0.508 
 6. Irving	0.506 
 7. LaVine	0.501 
 8. Brown	0.490 
 9. Beal	0.483 
 10. Curry	0.481 
 11. Booker	0.481 
 12. Doncic	0.475 
 13. Fox	0.474 
 14. Sexton	0.472 
 15. Ingram	0.470 
 16. Tatum	0.455 
 17. Randle	0.452 
 18. Lillard	0.449 
 19. Mitchell	0.443 
 20. Young	0.432

&nbsp;

I doubt there is much surprise about the top, or the bottom of this list.  Zion is a dunk machine, almost 70% of his shots take place 0-3 feet from the basket, and nobody is going to stop his 284 lbs of fury.  **Ben Simmons, passing out of a wide open dunk, needs to watch some Zion footage.**

&nbsp;

The bottom of this list features two heavy volume shooters in Donovan Mitchell and Trae Young.  While 44% nightly field goal percentage isn't ""bad"", it's not great.  If you look at a lot of Hawks and/or Jazz box scores, you probably already had an inkling that neither of these two folks have an overwhelming amount of efficient nights.  **Mitchell had 10 nights this season where he shot worse than 35%, and Trae said ""*hold my beer*"" with 17 of his own nights (this is over 1/4th of his entire games played this season).**  Mitchell and Young are, at the very minimum, average in their TS+ (Trae being 103 and Mitchell being exactly league average at 100, though his actual TS is below league average .569 to .572), but both definitely struggle with consistent efficiency.

## **FG% (StDev)**

 1. Doncic	0.090 
 2. Leonard	0.098 
 3. Booker	0.101 
 4. Sexton	0.106

 18. Embiid	0.131 
 19. Williamson	0.133 
 20. Brown	0.134

&nbsp;

The top two, and bottom two, tell interesting stories.  Being ""consistent"" isn't always good, but it's also not always bad, it's all about context.  If you're a 25% shooter, you WANT your consistency to be way off, because you don't want to show up, every single night, and give 25% to your team.  **Luka leads the pack here, but it's not as good as Kawhi's efficiency, because Luka is extremely consistent at being averagely efficient (when compared to the top 20 here, as his average nightly Fg% is in the bottom half of this pack).**  Kawhi is in the top 5 for average nightly Fg%, as well as being 2nd on the list of standard deviation among his Fg% data.

&nbsp;

The bottom two, well ""*The Lord giveth, and the Lord taketh away*"".  Zion is, by far, the most efficient on a night by night basis, but due to the fact that his nightly Fg% is so absurdly high, he's going to have a decent amount of games where his Fg% is in the range of mere mortals.  **Zion had an impressive 10 games this season where he shot over 75%, but he also had 31 games this season where he shot below his nightly Fg% (though only 3 games where he was below 45%!).** 

&nbsp;

The Jaylen Brown stats are not that bad, hold those downvotes Celtics fans.  Yes, he's wildly inconsistent when compared to everyone else in this top 20, BUT, he's inconsistent on the good side.  He's 8th in his nightly Fg%, .490, pretty good.  **He had 29 games this season (over half his entire season) where he shot above that mark of .490, including an 85% night (17/20 shooting).**. Yeah, he's a bit erratic, but over half the time when he steps on the court, you're getting the ""*good*"" type of erratic; The type of erratic that John Starks fans loved.

## **Nightly 3pt% (Average)**

 1. Embiid	0.428 
 2. Curry	0.412 
 3. Randle	0.406 
 4. LaVine	0.404 
 5. Mitchell	0.398 
 6. Brown	0.398 
 7. Leonard	0.391

 20. Fox	0.295

&nbsp;

Ok, so yeah... This data set features the least practicable thing I thought I would see today, and the most predictable thing I would see today.  **When I started off this morning (7 hours ago from the moment I am typing this), I did NOT expect to see that Joel Embiid was going to be the most efficient 3Pt shooter out of the entire top 20 scorers in the league (on a night by night basis).** I will explain how this works in the next breakdown, where I talk about 3Pt% StDev.  Worry not Warriors fans, Steph is still the premiere ""*God Tier*"" 3Pt shooter in the league.

&nbsp;

*Exhales...* Let me begin this by saying that I'm a 30+ year Suns fan.  I pre-date the Barkley trade, and have been with them through all of the good, and all of the bad.  When I was stationed in Europe, I would stay up at crazy hours, just so I could root for the Purple and Orange.  I went to games at the Madhouse on McDowell.  With that out of the way: Devin Booker is a very inefficient 3Pt shooter.  As you've seen in the last game (assuming I get this out before this evening's game), he's not a ""*bad*"" 3Pt shooter (he hit a few HUGE threes), but he is rather inefficient on a night-to-night basis.  You don't even have to watch Suns games to understand this either, you can look at the box scores.  **The league average (this season) was .367 from 3, wanna guess how many games Devin spent below the league average?**  39 games (58% of the games he played this season), including 10 games where he was 0% from 3.  

## **3Pt% (StDev)**

 1. Lillard	0.151 
 2. Curry	0.158 
 3. Tatum	0.180 
 4. Doncic	0.188 
 5. LaVine	0.193 
 6. Fox	0.196 
 7. Brown	0.196 
 8. Ingram	0.200 
 9. Mitchell	0.201 
 10. Booker	0.207 
 11. Beal	0.219 
 12. Young	0.221 
 13. Irving	0.223 
 14. Leonard	0.257 
 15. Randle	0.258 
 16. Antetokounmpo	0.259 
 17. Sexton	0.273 
 18. Jokic	0.305 
 19. Embiid	0.337 
 20. Williamson	0.450

&nbsp;

Lets address the open item from the breakdown before this one.  **Embiid is not an elite 3Pt shooter, he just doesn't shoot a lot (for a 3Pt shooter) and he has a decent number (8 to be exact) of 100% nights (where he went 1/1 or 2/2).**   Yes, Book has 10 nights of 0%, but Embiid has 12 nights of the same percentage.  Roughly 24% of the time Joel steps onto the court, he's going to be a complete dud from 3.

&nbsp;

**Steph is still the gold standard when it comes to 3Pt shooting.**  Lillard is on top of this list, meaning that he's the most consistent, but all that means is that he's the most consistent at bringing home a nightly 3Pt% lower than Steph (8% lower, relatively).  Props to Dame, but Curry is the King, all Hail to the Chef.

## **Nightly Ft% (Average)**

 1. Irving	0.923 
 2. Curry	0.914 
 3. Lillard	0.906 
 4. Young	0.891 
 5. Leonard	0.885 
 6. Beal	0.883 
 7. Booker	0.865 
 8. Tatum	0.864 
 9. Ingram	0.860 
 10. LaVine	0.859 
 11. Jokic	0.857 
 12. Embiid	0.849 
 13. Mitchell	0.827 
 14. Sexton	0.816 
 15. Randle	0.803 
 16. Brown	0.770 
 17. Doncic	0.728 
 18. Williamson	0.707 
 19. Fox	0.705 
 20. Antetokounmpo	0.683

&nbsp;

Well, it was nice knowing you.  This is likely where everyone checks out, if you haven't checked out already (lets be real, this is a wall of text after all).  Not many folks are going to care about Ft%, except for the diehard stat-heads.

&nbsp;

**Kyrie had a 50/40/90 season (and 36 perfect games), Steph is on the same level as Steve Nash when it comes to free throws (he had 36 as well), and Dame is an elite-level free throw shooter as well (38 perfect games for Dolla).**  Not many surprises here.

&nbsp;

**And coming in at the bottom, the Balkan Brick himself, Giannis.**  To be honest though, it's not nearly as bad as I thought it would be, and he only had 1 game of 0% all year

## **FT% (StDev)**

 1. Young	0.116 
 2. Beal	0.131 
 3. Curry	0.134 
 4. Booker	0.152 
 5. Irving	0.154 
 6. Lillard	0.162 
 7. Williamson	0.162 
 8. Embiid	0.163 
 9. Leonard	0.167 
 10. Fox	0.179 
 11. Sexton	0.179 
 12. Randle	0.183 
 13. Tatum	0.190 
 14. Mitchell	0.193 
 15. Jokic	0.195 
 16. Antetokounmpo	0.195 
 17. LaVine	0.201 
 18. Doncic	0.209 
 19. Ingram	0.217 
 20. Brown	0.260

&nbsp;

I'm on the home stretch.  I'm going to make a PB&J sandwich after this, and it's going to be awesome.

&nbsp;

**The reason why I love Trae Young is specifically this.  Yes, he's pretty inefficient, but the man makes up for it at the line.**  He is an elite Ft shooter, and he's massively consistent at being elite.  His consistency at the line is unparalleled, only having one game of below .667 this entire season (Steph had 4, Dame had 3, Kyrie had 2).  

&nbsp;

**Celtics fans, I don't hate your team, Jaylen Brown is just a weird guy.**  His consistency at the line isn't great, but he also hardly gets there on a night to night basis.  Jaylen had nine games this year where he didn't even get to the line at all.  He had two 0% games, which is double what Giannis, but he also had 20 perfect games.  He plays nothing like John Starks, but his consistency is very reminiscent of him.

## **Conclusions**
**If you take anything away from reading this, please understand that EVERYTHING in basketball is relational.** Someone's PPG doesn't matter, if you don't know the percentages behind it.  Someone's ORTG or DRTG means nothing if you don't know specific components of their game behind said rating (case in point, Robin Lopez once led the league in ORTG, look it up, 2013-2014 season).
&nbsp;


**Being consistent is neither good nor bad, without knowing someone's efficiency to begin with.**  Being consistently inefficient is bad, and being inconsistently good is also bad.  They are two wildly different metrics, but they also need each other in order to having any meaning at all.

&nbsp;

I hope you enjoyed my Ted Talk.  Thank you for reading this.

If a player oscillates between being so good he always wins (60% of the time) and so bad he always loses (40% of the time) he's going to have really high variance and probably middle of the road averages.  But he's going to lead a team to ~50 wins and about a 70% chance of winning any individual series.   Obviously no one is actually that extreme, but high variance players are not necessarily a bad thing and can be very valuable.  Being inconsistently great is worse than being consistently great (obviously) but it can be (a lot) better than being consistently above average.",4,0.073,0.679,0.247,0.9817,3.9699999999999998
"nba","rushhourIV","Consistency and Efficiency, a study of the top 20 scorers in the NBA this year","2021-11-07 2:32:46 PM","# **Preface**
If you're a stat-head like me, you likely spend a lot of time looking at every chart for a given player on Basketball Reference (or insert your stat site of choice).  There is a lot of powerful information in available metrics (especially adjusted shooting), but the one area where stats seem a bit deficient, is **quantifying ""consistency"" and ""efficiency""**.  
 
&nbsp;

Player ""X"" may average 25ppg on 55% Fg and 40% 3Pt, but that doesn't tell you anything about the spread of data.  Basically, it's difficult to look at a cumulative stat sheet for a player, and derive how often that 25ppg/55% Fg/40% 3Pt player shows up each night.  The lack of a consistency metric leads to a lot of speculative opinions about players; ""Player 'X' is good, but he's streaky and has a lot of hot and cold nights.""  Without watching every single game for Player ""X"", or looking at the entire gamelog for a season, it's difficult to have a response to said speculation, without you speculating as well, leading to *an ouroboros of speculation*.  
  
&nbsp;

This morning, I sat down, and went through the entire season of gamelogs for each of the top 20 scorers in the NBA, to provide both myself, as well as you all, with a little bit of clarity on how consistent, and efficient each of those players are.  

&nbsp;

# **Understandings (please read this)**  
There are two very important understandings that must be had, when looking at this data.  They are:

 * Nightly Average Shooting %
 * Standard Deviation (or StDev)

&nbsp;

## **Nightly Average Shooting %**

While this is the ""less complicated"" of the two, I am covering this one first, because I know this one will cause the most confusion.  

&nbsp;

The shooting percentages you see on a stat sheet, are an *average of cumulative metrics*.  The shooting percentages you will see in my tables, do not take this into consideration, because an average of all shots for an entire season doesn't tell you anything about consistency.

&nbsp;

 **Example**
For this example, lets take an imaginary 7 game series (to make this as simple as possible).  In this scenario, lets say Steph Curry had 3Pt shooting nights of:

* 10/10  
* 10/10  
* 0/5  
* 0/2  
* 0/3  
* 0/4  
* 0/5 

&nbsp;

Steph's 3pt shooting percentage of this series would be 20/39, or 51.28%.  If you just looked at that 51.28%, you would think ""*How did the Warriors lose?  Steph shot over 50% from 3!*""  The actual truth would be that **for over half the series, Steph shot very poorly**, he had 2 great games, and 5 bad games.  His **Nightly Average 3pt%** would be 28.57% ( much lower than his series 3Pt% of 51.28%). 

&nbsp; 

## **Standard Deviation (StDev)**  
  
This one is going to be a bit rough, and I'm going to keep it as simple as possible.  Professional data scientists, actual statisticians, and people that are REALLY deep into ""*stonks*"" will know what this is without having to read this section.  
  
&nbsp;

Here is a very layman's explanation of StDev and what you need to know:  
  
 1. StDev is the measurement of volatility of a data set.  Basically, how spread the data is.  
 2. **LOWER IS ALWAYS BETTER when consistency is a concern**  
 3. It's a bit more complicated than this, and without boring you with a lot of math, if you're curious on how StDev works, there are some great YouTube videos that describe it in a very digestible/visual way.  There is no shame in watching them, because even I had to do it, 5 years ago, when I first started using StDev as a method to evaluate data in my primary hobby, astrophotography.  
&nbsp;

## **The Actual Data!**  

*Note 1: This data is sorted by actual PPG, I will have breakdowns of each section below the table*  
*Note 2: Bold means ""leader among the Top 20""*  
*Note 3: Italics means ""worst among the Top 20""*

This list doesn't need a lot of analysis, you can get this list directly from Basketball Reference.  You don't/shouldn't need anyone to break down PPG for you.  If PPG were a TV show, it would be ""The Office"", because everyone can understand it, and everyone quotes it.

&nbsp;

I guess all of the ""robotic"" jokes about Kawhi Leonard have some statistical basis.  **Out of all of the top 20 scorers, Kawhi had the greatest chance of bringing every point of that 24.8 PPG to the table each game.**  His season high was 36 points, and his low was 13 points.

&nbsp;

Curry, well, when you carry a team that hard, I guess there will be a lot of fluctuation in your points output.  **His season average was 31.98 (basically 32), and he had 29 games of sub-average performance, and three games where he didn't even score half of his season average.**  His season high was 62 points (18 ft, 8 threes, and 18 buckets overall), and his season low was 11 (2 of 16 shooting for that game). 

## **Nightly Fg% (Average)**

 1. Williamson	0.621 
 2. Jokic	0.576 
 3. Antetokounmpo	0.574 
 4. Leonard	0.521 
 5. Embiid	0.508

 17. Randle	0.452 
 18. Lillard	0.449 
 19. Mitchell	0.443 
 20. Young	0.432

&nbsp;

I doubt there is much surprise about the top, or the bottom of this list.  Zion is a dunk machine, almost 70% of his shots take place 0-3 feet from the basket, and nobody is going to stop his 284 lbs of fury.  **Ben Simmons, passing out of a wide open dunk, needs to watch some Zion footage.**

&nbsp;

The bottom of this list features two heavy volume shooters in Donovan Mitchell and Trae Young.  While 44% nightly field goal percentage isn't ""bad"", it's not great.  If you look at a lot of Hawks and/or Jazz box scores, you probably already had an inkling that neither of these two folks have an overwhelming amount of efficient nights.  **Mitchell had 10 nights this season where he shot worse than 35%, and Trae said ""*hold my beer*"" with 17 of his own nights (this is over 1/4th of his entire games played this season).**  Mitchell and Young are, at the very minimum, average in their TS+ (Trae being 103 and Mitchell being exactly league average at 100, though his actual TS is below league average .569 to .572), but both definitely struggle with consistent efficiency.

## **FG% (StDev)**

 1. Doncic	0.090 
 2. Leonard	0.098 
 3. Booker	0.101 
 4. Sexton	0.106 
 5. Beal	0.109 
 6. Lillard	0.109

 17. Young	0.130 
 18. Embiid	0.131 
 19. Williamson	0.133 
 20. Brown	0.134

&nbsp;

The top two, and bottom two, tell interesting stories.  Being ""consistent"" isn't always good, but it's also not always bad, it's all about context.  If you're a 25% shooter, you WANT your consistency to be way off, because you don't want to show up, every single night, and give 25% to your team.  **Luka leads the pack here, but it's not as good as Kawhi's efficiency, because Luka is extremely consistent at being averagely efficient (when compared to the top 20 here, as his average nightly Fg% is in the bottom half of this pack).**  Kawhi is in the top 5 for average nightly Fg%, as well as being 2nd on the list of standard deviation among his Fg% data.

&nbsp;

The bottom two, well ""*The Lord giveth, and the Lord taketh away*"".  Zion is, by far, the most efficient on a night by night basis, but due to the fact that his nightly Fg% is so absurdly high, he's going to have a decent amount of games where his Fg% is in the range of mere mortals.  **Zion had an impressive 10 games this season where he shot over 75%, but he also had 31 games this season where he shot below his nightly Fg% (though only 3 games where he was below 45%!).** 

&nbsp;

The Jaylen Brown stats are not that bad, hold those downvotes Celtics fans.  Yes, he's wildly inconsistent when compared to everyone else in this top 20, BUT, he's inconsistent on the good side.  He's 8th in his nightly Fg%, .490, pretty good.  **He had 29 games this season (over half his entire season) where he shot above that mark of .490, including an 85% night (17/20 shooting).**. Yeah, he's a bit erratic, but over half the time when he steps on the court, you're getting the ""*good*"" type of erratic; The type of erratic that John Starks fans loved.

## **Nightly 3pt% (Average)**

 1. Embiid	0.428 
 2. Curry	0.412 
 3. Randle	0.406 
 4. LaVine	0.404 
 5. Mitchell	0.398

&nbsp;

Ok, so yeah... This data set features the least practicable thing I thought I would see today, and the most predictable thing I would see today.  **When I started off this morning (7 hours ago from the moment I am typing this), I did NOT expect to see that Joel Embiid was going to be the most efficient 3Pt shooter out of the entire top 20 scorers in the league (on a night by night basis).** I will explain how this works in the next breakdown, where I talk about 3Pt% StDev.  Worry not Warriors fans, Steph is still the premiere ""*God Tier*"" 3Pt shooter in the league.

&nbsp;

*Exhales...* Let me begin this by saying that I'm a 30+ year Suns fan.  I pre-date the Barkley trade, and have been with them through all of the good, and all of the bad.  When I was stationed in Europe, I would stay up at crazy hours, just so I could root for the Purple and Orange.  I went to games at the Madhouse on McDowell.  With that out of the way: Devin Booker is a very inefficient 3Pt shooter.  As you've seen in the last game (assuming I get this out before this evening's game), he's not a ""*bad*"" 3Pt shooter (he hit a few HUGE threes), but he is rather inefficient on a night-to-night basis.  You don't even have to watch Suns games to understand this either, you can look at the box scores.  **The league average (this season) was .367 from 3, wanna guess how many games Devin spent below the league average?**  39 games (58% of the games he played this season), including 10 games where he was 0% from 3.  

## **3Pt% (StDev)**

 1. Lillard	0.151 
 2. Curry	0.158 
 3. Tatum	0.180 
 4. Doncic	0.188 
 5. LaVine	0.193 
 6. Fox	0.196 
 7. Brown	0.196 
 8. Ingram	0.200 
 9. Mitchell	0.201 
 10. Booker	0.207 
 11. Beal	0.219 
 12. Young	0.221 
 13. Irving	0.223 
 14. Leonard	0.257 
 15. Randle	0.258 
 16. Antetokounmpo	0.259 
 17. Sexton	0.273 
 18. Jokic	0.305 
 19. Embiid	0.337 
 20. Williamson	0.450

&nbsp;

Lets address the open item from the breakdown before this one.  **Embiid is not an elite 3Pt shooter, he just doesn't shoot a lot (for a 3Pt shooter) and he has a decent number (8 to be exact) of 100% nights (where he went 1/1 or 2/2).**   Yes, Book has 10 nights of 0%, but Embiid has 12 nights of the same percentage.  Roughly 24% of the time Joel steps onto the court, he's going to be a complete dud from 3.

&nbsp;

**Steph is still the gold standard when it comes to 3Pt shooting.**  Lillard is on top of this list, meaning that he's the most consistent, but all that means is that he's the most consistent at bringing home a nightly 3Pt% lower than Steph (8% lower, relatively).  Props to Dame, but Curry is the King, all Hail to the Chef.

## **Nightly Ft% (Average)**

 1. Irving	0.923 
 2. Curry	0.914 
 3. Lillard	0.906 
 4. Young	0.891 
 5. Leonard	0.885 
 6. Beal	0.883 
 7. Booker	0.865 
 8. Tatum	0.864 
 9. Ingram	0.860 
 10. LaVine	0.859 
 11. Jokic	0.857 
 12. Embiid	0.849 
 13. Mitchell	0.827 
 14. Sexton	0.816 
 15. Randle	0.803 
 16. Brown	0.770 
 17. Doncic	0.728 
 18. Williamson	0.707 
 19. Fox	0.705 
 20. Antetokounmpo	0.683

&nbsp;

Well, it was nice knowing you.  This is likely where everyone checks out, if you haven't checked out already (lets be real, this is a wall of text after all).  Not many folks are going to care about Ft%, except for the diehard stat-heads.

&nbsp;

**Kyrie had a 50/40/90 season (and 36 perfect games), Steph is on the same level as Steve Nash when it comes to free throws (he had 36 as well), and Dame is an elite-level free throw shooter as well (38 perfect games for Dolla).**  Not many surprises here.

&nbsp;

**And coming in at the bottom, the Balkan Brick himself, Giannis.**  To be honest though, it's not nearly as bad as I thought it would be, and he only had 1 game of 0% all year

## **FT% (StDev)**

 1. Young	0.116 
 2. Beal	0.131 
 3. Curry	0.134 
 4. Booker	0.152 
 5. Irving	0.154 
 6. Lillard	0.162 
 7. Williamson	0.162 
 8. Embiid	0.163 
 9. Leonard	0.167 
 10. Fox	0.179 
 11. Sexton	0.179 
 12. Randle	0.183 
 13. Tatum	0.190 
 14. Mitchell	0.193 
 15. Jokic	0.195 
 16. Antetokounmpo	0.195 
 17. LaVine	0.201 
 18. Doncic	0.209 
 19. Ingram	0.217 
 20. Brown	0.260

&nbsp;

I'm on the home stretch.  I'm going to make a PB&J sandwich after this, and it's going to be awesome.

&nbsp;

**The reason why I love Trae Young is specifically this.  Yes, he's pretty inefficient, but the man makes up for it at the line.**  He is an elite Ft shooter, and he's massively consistent at being elite.  His consistency at the line is unparalleled, only having one game of below .667 this entire season (Steph had 4, Dame had 3, Kyrie had 2).  

&nbsp;

**Celtics fans, I don't hate your team, Jaylen Brown is just a weird guy.**  His consistency at the line isn't great, but he also hardly gets there on a night to night basis.  Jaylen had nine games this year where he didn't even get to the line at all.  He had two 0% games, which is double what Giannis, but he also had 20 perfect games.  He plays nothing like John Starks, but his consistency is very reminiscent of him.

## **Conclusions**
**If you take anything away from reading this, please understand that EVERYTHING in basketball is relational.** Someone's PPG doesn't matter, if you don't know the percentages behind it.  Someone's ORTG or DRTG means nothing if you don't know specific components of their game behind said rating (case in point, Robin Lopez once led the league in ORTG, look it up, 2013-2014 season).
&nbsp;


**Being consistent is neither good nor bad, without knowing someone's efficiency to begin with.**  Being consistently inefficient is bad, and being inconsistently good is also bad.  They are two wildly different metrics, but they also need each other in order to having any meaning at all.

&nbsp;

I hope you enjoyed my Ted Talk.  Thank you for reading this.

If you're a stat-head like me, you likely spend a lot of time looking at every chart for a given player on Basketball Reference (or insert your stat site of choice).  There is a lot of powerful information in available metrics (especially adjusted shooting), but the one area where stats seem a bit deficient, is **quantifying ""consistency"" and ""efficiency""**.  
 
&nbsp;

Player ""X"" may average 25ppg on 55% Fg and 40% 3Pt, but that doesn't tell you anything about the spread of data.  Basically, it's difficult to look at a cumulative stat sheet for a player, and derive how often that 25ppg/55% Fg/40% 3Pt player shows up each night.  The lack of a consistency metric leads to a lot of speculative opinions about players; ""Player 'X' is good, but he's streaky and has a lot of hot and cold nights.""  Without watching every single game for Player ""X"", or looking at the entire gamelog for a season, it's difficult to have a response to said speculation, without you speculating as well, leading to *an ouroboros of speculation*.  
  
&nbsp;

This morning, I sat down, and went through the entire season of gamelogs for each of the top 20 scorers in the NBA, to provide both myself, as well as you all, with a little bit of clarity on how consistent, and efficient each of those players are.  

&nbsp;

# **Understandings (please read this)**  
There are two very important understandings that must be had, when looking at this data.  They are:

 * Nightly Average Shooting %
 * Standard Deviation (or StDev)

&nbsp;

## **Nightly Average Shooting %**

While this is the ""less complicated"" of the two, I am covering this one first, because I know this one will cause the most confusion.  

&nbsp;

The shooting percentages you see on a stat sheet, are an *average of cumulative metrics*.  The shooting percentages you will see in my tables, do not take this into consideration, because an average of all shots for an entire season doesn't tell you anything about consistency.

&nbsp;

 **Example**
For this example, lets take an imaginary 7 game series (to make this as simple as possible).  In this scenario, lets say Steph Curry had 3Pt shooting nights of:

* 10/10  
* 10/10  
* 0/5  
* 0/2  
* 0/3  
* 0/4  
* 0/5 

&nbsp;

Steph's 3pt shooting percentage of this series would be 20/39, or 51.28%.  If you just looked at that 51.28%, you would think ""*How did the Warriors lose?  Steph shot over 50% from 3!*""  The actual truth would be that **for over half the series, Steph shot very poorly**, he had 2 great games, and 5 bad games.  His **Nightly Average 3pt%** would be 28.57% ( much lower than his series 3Pt% of 51.28%). 

&nbsp; 

## **Standard Deviation (StDev)**  
  
This one is going to be a bit rough, and I'm going to keep it as simple as possible.  Professional data scientists, actual statisticians, and people that are REALLY deep into ""*stonks*"" will know what this is without having to read this section.  
  
&nbsp;

Here is a very layman's explanation of StDev and what you need to know:  
  
 1. StDev is the measurement of volatility of a data set.  Basically, how spread the data is.  
 2. **LOWER IS ALWAYS BETTER when consistency is a concern**  
 3. It's a bit more complicated than this, and without boring you with a lot of math, if you're curious on how StDev works, there are some great YouTube videos that describe it in a very digestible/visual way.  There is no shame in watching them, because even I had to do it, 5 years ago, when I first started using StDev as a method to evaluate data in my primary hobby, astrophotography.  
&nbsp;

## **The Actual Data!**  

*Note 1: This data is sorted by actual PPG, I will have breakdowns of each section below the table*  
*Note 2: Bold means ""leader among the Top 20""*  
*Note 3: Italics means ""worst among the Top 20""*

This list doesn't need a lot of analysis, you can get this list directly from Basketball Reference.  You don't/shouldn't need anyone to break down PPG for you.  If PPG were a TV show, it would be ""The Office"", because everyone can understand it, and everyone quotes it.

I guess all of the ""robotic"" jokes about Kawhi Leonard have some statistical basis.  **Out of all of the top 20 scorers, Kawhi had the greatest chance of bringing every point of that 24.8 PPG to the table each game.**  His season high was 36 points, and his low was 13 points.

&nbsp;

Curry, well, when you carry a team that hard, I guess there will be a lot of fluctuation in your points output.  **His season average was 31.98 (basically 32), and he had 29 games of sub-average performance, and three games where he didn't even score half of his season average.**  His season high was 62 points (18 ft, 8 threes, and 18 buckets overall), and his season low was 11 (2 of 16 shooting for that game).

&nbsp;

I doubt there is much surprise about the top, or the bottom of this list.  Zion is a dunk machine, almost 70% of his shots take place 0-3 feet from the basket, and nobody is going to stop his 284 lbs of fury.  **Ben Simmons, passing out of a wide open dunk, needs to watch some Zion footage.**

&nbsp;

The bottom of this list features two heavy volume shooters in Donovan Mitchell and Trae Young.  While 44% nightly field goal percentage isn't ""bad"", it's not great.  If you look at a lot of Hawks and/or Jazz box scores, you probably already had an inkling that neither of these two folks have an overwhelming amount of efficient nights.  **Mitchell had 10 nights this season where he shot worse than 35%, and Trae said ""*hold my beer*"" with 17 of his own nights (this is over 1/4th of his entire games played this season).**  Mitchell and Young are, at the very minimum, average in their TS+ (Trae being 103 and Mitchell being exactly league average at 100, though his actual TS is below league average .569 to .572), but both definitely struggle with consistent efficiency.

## **FG% (StDev)**

&nbsp;

The top two, and bottom two, tell interesting stories.  Being ""consistent"" isn't always good, but it's also not always bad, it's all about context.  If you're a 25% shooter, you WANT your consistency to be way off, because you don't want to show up, every single night, and give 25% to your team.  **Luka leads the pack here, but it's not as good as Kawhi's efficiency, because Luka is extremely consistent at being averagely efficient (when compared to the top 20 here, as his average nightly Fg% is in the bottom half of this pack).**  Kawhi is in the top 5 for average nightly Fg%, as well as being 2nd on the list of standard deviation among his Fg% data.

&nbsp;

The bottom two, well ""*The Lord giveth, and the Lord taketh away*"".  Zion is, by far, the most efficient on a night by night basis, but due to the fact that his nightly Fg% is so absurdly high, he's going to have a decent amount of games where his Fg% is in the range of mere mortals.  **Zion had an impressive 10 games this season where he shot over 75%, but he also had 31 games this season where he shot below his nightly Fg% (though only 3 games where he was below 45%!).** 

&nbsp;

The Jaylen Brown stats are not that bad, hold those downvotes Celtics fans.  Yes, he's wildly inconsistent when compared to everyone else in this top 20, BUT, he's inconsistent on the good side.  He's 8th in his nightly Fg%, .490, pretty good.  **He had 29 games this season (over half his entire season) where he shot above that mark of .490, including an 85% night (17/20 shooting).**. Yeah, he's a bit erratic, but over half the time when he steps on the court, you're getting the ""*good*"" type of erratic; The type of erratic that John Starks fans loved.

## **Nightly 3pt% (Average)**

 1. Embiid	0.428 
 2. Curry	0.412

&nbsp;

Ok, so yeah... This data set features the least practicable thing I thought I would see today, and the most predictable thing I would see today.  **When I started off this morning (7 hours ago from the moment I am typing this), I did NOT expect to see that Joel Embiid was going to be the most efficient 3Pt shooter out of the entire top 20 scorers in the league (on a night by night basis).** I will explain how this works in the next breakdown, where I talk about 3Pt% StDev.  Worry not Warriors fans, Steph is still the premiere ""*God Tier*"" 3Pt shooter in the league.

&nbsp;

*Exhales...* Let me begin this by saying that I'm a 30+ year Suns fan.  I pre-date the Barkley trade, and have been with them through all of the good, and all of the bad.  When I was stationed in Europe, I would stay up at crazy hours, just so I could root for the Purple and Orange.  I went to games at the Madhouse on McDowell.  With that out of the way: Devin Booker is a very inefficient 3Pt shooter.  As you've seen in the last game (assuming I get this out before this evening's game), he's not a ""*bad*"" 3Pt shooter (he hit a few HUGE threes), but he is rather inefficient on a night-to-night basis.  You don't even have to watch Suns games to understand this either, you can look at the box scores.  **The league average (this season) was .367 from 3, wanna guess how many games Devin spent below the league average?**  39 games (58% of the games he played this season), including 10 games where he was 0% from 3.  

## **3Pt% (StDev)**

 1. Lillard	0.151 
 2. Curry	0.158 
 3. Tatum	0.180 
 4. Doncic	0.188 
 5. LaVine	0.193 
 6. Fox	0.196 
 7. Brown	0.196 
 8. Ingram	0.200 
 9. Mitchell	0.201 
 10. Booker	0.207 
 11. Beal	0.219 
 12. Young	0.221 
 13. Irving	0.223 
 14. Leonard	0.257 
 15. Randle	0.258 
 16. Antetokounmpo	0.259 
 17. Sexton	0.273 
 18. Jokic	0.305 
 19. Embiid	0.337 
 20. Williamson	0.450

&nbsp;

Lets address the open item from the breakdown before this one.  **Embiid is not an elite 3Pt shooter, he just doesn't shoot a lot (for a 3Pt shooter) and he has a decent number (8 to be exact) of 100% nights (where he went 1/1 or 2/2).**   Yes, Book has 10 nights of 0%, but Embiid has 12 nights of the same percentage.  Roughly 24% of the time Joel steps onto the court, he's going to be a complete dud from 3.

&nbsp;

**Steph is still the gold standard when it comes to 3Pt shooting.**  Lillard is on top of this list, meaning that he's the most consistent, but all that means is that he's the most consistent at bringing home a nightly 3Pt% lower than Steph (8% lower, relatively).  Props to Dame, but Curry is the King, all Hail to the Chef.

## **Nightly Ft% (Average)**

 1. Irving	0.923 
 2. Curry	0.914 
 3. Lillard	0.906 
 4. Young	0.891 
 5. Leonard	0.885 
 6. Beal	0.883 
 7. Booker	0.865 
 8. Tatum	0.864 
 9. Ingram	0.860 
 10. LaVine	0.859 
 11. Jokic	0.857 
 12. Embiid	0.849 
 13. Mitchell	0.827 
 14. Sexton	0.816 
 15. Randle	0.803 
 16. Brown	0.770 
 17. Doncic	0.728 
 18. Williamson	0.707 
 19. Fox	0.705 
 20. Antetokounmpo	0.683

&nbsp;

Well, it was nice knowing you.  This is likely where everyone checks out, if you haven't checked out already (lets be real, this is a wall of text after all).  Not many folks are going to care about Ft%, except for the diehard stat-heads.

&nbsp;

**Kyrie had a 50/40/90 season (and 36 perfect games), Steph is on the same level as Steve Nash when it comes to free throws (he had 36 as well), and Dame is an elite-level free throw shooter as well (38 perfect games for Dolla).**  Not many surprises here.

&nbsp;

**And coming in at the bottom, the Balkan Brick himself, Giannis.**  To be honest though, it's not nearly as bad as I thought it would be, and he only had 1 game of 0% all year

## **FT% (StDev)**

 1. Young	0.116 
 2. Beal	0.131 
 3. Curry	0.134 
 4. Booker	0.152 
 5. Irving	0.154 
 6. Lillard	0.162 
 7. Williamson	0.162 
 8. Embiid	0.163 
 9. Leonard	0.167 
 10. Fox	0.179 
 11. Sexton	0.179 
 12. Randle	0.183 
 13. Tatum	0.190 
 14. Mitchell	0.193 
 15. Jokic	0.195 
 16. Antetokounmpo	0.195 
 17. LaVine	0.201 
 18. Doncic	0.209 
 19. Ingram	0.217 
 20. Brown	0.260

&nbsp;

I'm on the home stretch.  I'm going to make a PB&J sandwich after this, and it's going to be awesome.

&nbsp;

**The reason why I love Trae Young is specifically this.  Yes, he's pretty inefficient, but the man makes up for it at the line.**  He is an elite Ft shooter, and he's massively consistent at being elite.  His consistency at the line is unparalleled, only having one game of below .667 this entire season (Steph had 4, Dame had 3, Kyrie had 2).  

&nbsp;

**Celtics fans, I don't hate your team, Jaylen Brown is just a weird guy.**  His consistency at the line isn't great, but he also hardly gets there on a night to night basis.  Jaylen had nine games this year where he didn't even get to the line at all.  He had two 0% games, which is double what Giannis, but he also had 20 perfect games.  He plays nothing like John Starks, but his consistency is very reminiscent of him.

## **Conclusions**
**If you take anything away from reading this, please understand that EVERYTHING in basketball is relational.** Someone's PPG doesn't matter, if you don't know the percentages behind it.  Someone's ORTG or DRTG means nothing if you don't know specific components of their game behind said rating (case in point, Robin Lopez once led the league in ORTG, look it up, 2013-2014 season).
&nbsp;


**Being consistent is neither good nor bad, without knowing someone's efficiency to begin with.**  Being consistently inefficient is bad, and being inconsistently good is also bad.  They are two wildly different metrics, but they also need each other in order to having any meaning at all.

I hope you enjoyed my Ted Talk.  Thank you for reading this.

If you're a stat-head like me, you likely spend a lot of time looking at every chart for a given player on Basketball Reference (or insert your stat site of choice).  There is a lot of powerful information in available metrics (especially adjusted shooting), but the one area where stats seem a bit deficient, is **quantifying ""consistency"" and ""efficiency""**.  
 
&nbsp;

Player ""X"" may average 25ppg on 55% Fg and 40% 3Pt, but that doesn't tell you anything about the spread of data.  Basically, it's difficult to look at a cumulative stat sheet for a player, and derive how often that 25ppg/55% Fg/40% 3Pt player shows up each night.  The lack of a consistency metric leads to a lot of speculative opinions about players; ""Player 'X' is good, but he's streaky and has a lot of hot and cold nights.""  Without watching every single game for Player ""X"", or looking at the entire gamelog for a season, it's difficult to have a response to said speculation, without you speculating as well, leading to *an ouroboros of speculation*.  
  
&nbsp;

This morning, I sat down, and went through the entire season of gamelogs for each of the top 20 scorers in the NBA, to provide both myself, as well as you all, with a little bit of clarity on how consistent, and efficient each of those players are.  

&nbsp;

# **Understandings (please read this)**  
There are two very important understandings that must be had, when looking at this data.  They are:

 * Nightly Average Shooting %
 * Standard Deviation (or StDev)

&nbsp;

## **Nightly Average Shooting %**

While this is the ""less complicated"" of the two, I am covering this one first, because I know this one will cause the most confusion.  

&nbsp;

The shooting percentages you see on a stat sheet, are an *average of cumulative metrics*.  The shooting percentages you will see in my tables, do not take this into consideration, because an average of all shots for an entire season doesn't tell you anything about consistency.

&nbsp;

 **Example**
For this example, lets take an imaginary 7 game series (to make this as simple as possible).  In this scenario, lets say Steph Curry had 3Pt shooting nights of:

* 10/10  
* 10/10  
* 0/5  
* 0/2  
* 0/3  
* 0/4  
* 0/5 

&nbsp;

Steph's 3pt shooting percentage of this series would be 20/39, or 51.28%.  If you just looked at that 51.28%, you would think ""*How did the Warriors lose?  Steph shot over 50% from 3!*""  The actual truth would be that **for over half the series, Steph shot very poorly**, he had 2 great games, and 5 bad games.  His **Nightly Average 3pt%** would be 28.57% ( much lower than his series 3Pt% of 51.28%). 

&nbsp; 

## **Standard Deviation (StDev)**  
  
This one is going to be a bit rough, and I'm going to keep it as simple as possible.  Professional data scientists, actual statisticians, and people that are REALLY deep into ""*stonks*"" will know what this is without having to read this section.  
  
&nbsp;

Here is a very layman's explanation of StDev and what you need to know:  
  
 1. StDev is the measurement of volatility of a data set.  Basically, how spread the data is.  
 2. **LOWER IS ALWAYS BETTER when consistency is a concern**  
 3. It's a bit more complicated than this, and without boring you with a lot of math, if you're curious on how StDev works, there are some great YouTube videos that describe it in a very digestible/visual way.  There is no shame in watching them, because even I had to do it, 5 years ago, when I first started using StDev as a method to evaluate data in my primary hobby, astrophotography.  
&nbsp;

This list doesn't need a lot of analysis, you can get this list directly from Basketball Reference.  You don't/shouldn't need anyone to break down PPG for you.  If PPG were a TV show, it would be ""The Office"", because everyone can understand it, and everyone quotes it.

I guess all of the ""robotic"" jokes about Kawhi Leonard have some statistical basis.  **Out of all of the top 20 scorers, Kawhi had the greatest chance of bringing every point of that 24.8 PPG to the table each game.**  His season high was 36 points, and his low was 13 points.

&nbsp;

Curry, well, when you carry a team that hard, I guess there will be a lot of fluctuation in your points output.  **His season average was 31.98 (basically 32), and he had 29 games of sub-average performance, and three games where he didn't even score half of his season average.**  His season high was 62 points (18 ft, 8 threes, and 18 buckets overall), and his season low was 11 (2 of 16 shooting for that game).

&nbsp;

I doubt there is much surprise about the top, or the bottom of this list.  Zion is a dunk machine, almost 70% of his shots take place 0-3 feet from the basket, and nobody is going to stop his 284 lbs of fury.  **Ben Simmons, passing out of a wide open dunk, needs to watch some Zion footage.**

&nbsp;

The bottom of this list features two heavy volume shooters in Donovan Mitchell and Trae Young.  While 44% nightly field goal percentage isn't ""bad"", it's not great.  If you look at a lot of Hawks and/or Jazz box scores, you probably already had an inkling that neither of these two folks have an overwhelming amount of efficient nights.  **Mitchell had 10 nights this season where he shot worse than 35%, and Trae said ""*hold my beer*"" with 17 of his own nights (this is over 1/4th of his entire games played this season).**  Mitchell and Young are, at the very minimum, average in their TS+ (Trae being 103 and Mitchell being exactly league average at 100, though his actual TS is below league average .569 to .572), but both definitely struggle with consistent efficiency.

 20. Brown	0.134

&nbsp;

The top two, and bottom two, tell interesting stories.  Being ""consistent"" isn't always good, but it's also not always bad, it's all about context.  If you're a 25% shooter, you WANT your consistency to be way off, because you don't want to show up, every single night, and give 25% to your team.  **Luka leads the pack here, but it's not as good as Kawhi's efficiency, because Luka is extremely consistent at being averagely efficient (when compared to the top 20 here, as his average nightly Fg% is in the bottom half of this pack).**  Kawhi is in the top 5 for average nightly Fg%, as well as being 2nd on the list of standard deviation among his Fg% data.

&nbsp;

The bottom two, well ""*The Lord giveth, and the Lord taketh away*"".  Zion is, by far, the most efficient on a night by night basis, but due to the fact that his nightly Fg% is so absurdly high, he's going to have a decent amount of games where his Fg% is in the range of mere mortals.  **Zion had an impressive 10 games this season where he shot over 75%, but he also had 31 games this season where he shot below his nightly Fg% (though only 3 games where he was below 45%!).** 

&nbsp;

The Jaylen Brown stats are not that bad, hold those downvotes Celtics fans.  Yes, he's wildly inconsistent when compared to everyone else in this top 20, BUT, he's inconsistent on the good side.  He's 8th in his nightly Fg%, .490, pretty good.  **He had 29 games this season (over half his entire season) where he shot above that mark of .490, including an 85% night (17/20 shooting).**. Yeah, he's a bit erratic, but over half the time when he steps on the court, you're getting the ""*good*"" type of erratic; The type of erratic that John Starks fans loved.

Ok, so yeah... This data set features the least practicable thing I thought I would see today, and the most predictable thing I would see today.  **When I started off this morning (7 hours ago from the moment I am typing this), I did NOT expect to see that Joel Embiid was going to be the most efficient 3Pt shooter out of the entire top 20 scorers in the league (on a night by night basis).** I will explain how this works in the next breakdown, where I talk about 3Pt% StDev.  Worry not Warriors fans, Steph is still the premiere ""*God Tier*"" 3Pt shooter in the league.

&nbsp;

*Exhales...* Let me begin this by saying that I'm a 30+ year Suns fan.  I pre-date the Barkley trade, and have been with them through all of the good, and all of the bad.  When I was stationed in Europe, I would stay up at crazy hours, just so I could root for the Purple and Orange.  I went to games at the Madhouse on McDowell.  With that out of the way: Devin Booker is a very inefficient 3Pt shooter.  As you've seen in the last game (assuming I get this out before this evening's game), he's not a ""*bad*"" 3Pt shooter (he hit a few HUGE threes), but he is rather inefficient on a night-to-night basis.  You don't even have to watch Suns games to understand this either, you can look at the box scores.  **The league average (this season) was .367 from 3, wanna guess how many games Devin spent below the league average?**  39 games (58% of the games he played this season), including 10 games where he was 0% from 3.

 5. LaVine	0.193 
 6. Fox	0.196 
 7. Brown	0.196 
 8. Ingram	0.200 
 9. Mitchell	0.201 
 10. Booker	0.207 
 11. Beal	0.219 
 12. Young	0.221

 15. Randle	0.258 
 16. Antetokounmpo	0.259 
 17. Sexton	0.273 
 18. Jokic	0.305 
 19. Embiid	0.337 
 20. Williamson	0.450

&nbsp;

Lets address the open item from the breakdown before this one.  **Embiid is not an elite 3Pt shooter, he just doesn't shoot a lot (for a 3Pt shooter) and he has a decent number (8 to be exact) of 100% nights (where he went 1/1 or 2/2).**   Yes, Book has 10 nights of 0%, but Embiid has 12 nights of the same percentage.  Roughly 24% of the time Joel steps onto the court, he's going to be a complete dud from 3.

&nbsp;

**Steph is still the gold standard when it comes to 3Pt shooting.**  Lillard is on top of this list, meaning that he's the most consistent, but all that means is that he's the most consistent at bringing home a nightly 3Pt% lower than Steph (8% lower, relatively).  Props to Dame, but Curry is the King, all Hail to the Chef.

## **Nightly Ft% (Average)**

 1. Irving	0.923 
 2. Curry	0.914 
 3. Lillard	0.906 
 4. Young	0.891 
 5. Leonard	0.885 
 6. Beal	0.883 
 7. Booker	0.865 
 8. Tatum	0.864 
 9. Ingram	0.860 
 10. LaVine	0.859 
 11. Jokic	0.857 
 12. Embiid	0.849 
 13. Mitchell	0.827 
 14. Sexton	0.816 
 15. Randle	0.803 
 16. Brown	0.770 
 17. Doncic	0.728 
 18. Williamson	0.707 
 19. Fox	0.705 
 20. Antetokounmpo	0.683

&nbsp;

Well, it was nice knowing you.  This is likely where everyone checks out, if you haven't checked out already (lets be real, this is a wall of text after all).  Not many folks are going to care about Ft%, except for the diehard stat-heads.

&nbsp;

**Kyrie had a 50/40/90 season (and 36 perfect games), Steph is on the same level as Steve Nash when it comes to free throws (he had 36 as well), and Dame is an elite-level free throw shooter as well (38 perfect games for Dolla).**  Not many surprises here.

&nbsp;

**And coming in at the bottom, the Balkan Brick himself, Giannis.**  To be honest though, it's not nearly as bad as I thought it would be, and he only had 1 game of 0% all year

## **FT% (StDev)**

 1. Young	0.116 
 2. Beal	0.131 
 3. Curry	0.134 
 4. Booker	0.152 
 5. Irving	0.154 
 6. Lillard	0.162 
 7. Williamson	0.162 
 8. Embiid	0.163 
 9. Leonard	0.167 
 10. Fox	0.179 
 11. Sexton	0.179 
 12. Randle	0.183 
 13. Tatum	0.190 
 14. Mitchell	0.193 
 15. Jokic	0.195 
 16. Antetokounmpo	0.195 
 17. LaVine	0.201 
 18. Doncic	0.209 
 19. Ingram	0.217 
 20. Brown	0.260

&nbsp;

I'm on the home stretch.  I'm going to make a PB&J sandwich after this, and it's going to be awesome.

&nbsp;

**The reason why I love Trae Young is specifically this.  Yes, he's pretty inefficient, but the man makes up for it at the line.**  He is an elite Ft shooter, and he's massively consistent at being elite.  His consistency at the line is unparalleled, only having one game of below .667 this entire season (Steph had 4, Dame had 3, Kyrie had 2).  

&nbsp;

**Celtics fans, I don't hate your team, Jaylen Brown is just a weird guy.**  His consistency at the line isn't great, but he also hardly gets there on a night to night basis.  Jaylen had nine games this year where he didn't even get to the line at all.  He had two 0% games, which is double what Giannis, but he also had 20 perfect games.  He plays nothing like John Starks, but his consistency is very reminiscent of him.

## **Conclusions**
**If you take anything away from reading this, please understand that EVERYTHING in basketball is relational.** Someone's PPG doesn't matter, if you don't know the percentages behind it.  Someone's ORTG or DRTG means nothing if you don't know specific components of their game behind said rating (case in point, Robin Lopez once led the league in ORTG, look it up, 2013-2014 season).
&nbsp;


**Being consistent is neither good nor bad, without knowing someone's efficiency to begin with.**  Being consistently inefficient is bad, and being inconsistently good is also bad.  They are two wildly different metrics, but they also need each other in order to having any meaning at all.

&nbsp;

On his previous contract (4/98!), he was one of the most maligned bigs in the league, for good reason. His gaudy numbers got him paid, but his impact on the game was usually negative due to attitude and defensive problems. The market caught up to him this past year, however, and he’s now making the minimum as a 3rd string center on a bad team. 

He’ll be a UFA this upcoming season. If it were your team, would you want to take a swing on his proven blocking and rebounding numbers off the bench? Or are his shortcoming enough that you wouldn’t want him at all, even in a much cheaper contract and a smaller role.

For me I think it’s one of the Warriors, Nuggets, Raptors or Celtics.

For the Warriors, their season depends on a lot of “if” scenarios such as when and how Klay comes back, if Steph can somewhat replicate his production, plus how much Wiseman, Poole and the rookies (if they don’t trade them) can develop, and how they work out their offseason. They’ve already made some significant changes to their coaching staff/development team to start. 

For the Nuggets, Jamal Murray’s return date is obviously a huge discussion point, and other big “ifs” are how big MPJ’s leap would be, plus how much of Jokic’s insane offensive production can be replicated and sustained for a full season (probably) without a good enough secondary ball handler, or if they’d get another guy to help the offense.

Toronto missed the playoffs, but they still have a solid core with Siakam, VanVleet & co., plus they have a top 4 pick. Lowry is also a free agent, but the Raptors can (finally) sign a competent center and possibly play actual home games.

The Celtics already started off with a big offseason news with trading away Kemba Walker for Al Horford, and their players may be able to stay relatively healthy this time. Jaylen Brown is healthy again, but how much would having Horford back again help, and how much would the new GM Brad Stevens and new head coach Ime Udoka work things out?","t3_oi8pug","https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/oi8pug/which_team_is_the_biggest_boom_or_bust_team_next/",48,100,"t1_h4uacze","2021-11-07 12:54:34 PM","It’s funny the sixers are one embiid injury away from a bust season, yet their regular season roster is ok, it’s got wizards vibes all over it.",2,0.091,0.744,0.165,0.3182,3.1500000000000004

The name ""Bucks"" was chosen because “bucks are spirited, good jumpers, fast and agile”. Almost 45 years later Giannis enters the league doing his best impression of a buck – he’s definitely spirited, he can jump out the gym, and doing so all while being fast and agile.

So has a player eclipsed Giannis as the perfect embodiment of his team’s name? Let’s find out.

\*Disclaimer – some teams’ names are too abstract or “wild” to embody (how does one embody a thunder? And what the \*\*\*\* is a clipper?) so I had to bend the rules a little bit. Also, as a so-called “nephew”, I tried to choose only players who played in the last 30ish years.

"nba","TimathanDuncan","Consistency and Efficiency, a study of the top 20 scorers in the NBA this year","2021-11-07 2:32:46 PM","# **Preface**
If you're a stat-head like me, you likely spend a lot of time looking at every chart for a given player on Basketball Reference (or insert your stat site of choice).  There is a lot of powerful information in available metrics (especially adjusted shooting), but the one area where stats seem a bit deficient, is **quantifying ""consistency"" and ""efficiency""**.  
 
&nbsp;

Player ""X"" may average 25ppg on 55% Fg and 40% 3Pt, but that doesn't tell you anything about the spread of data.  Basically, it's difficult to look at a cumulative stat sheet for a player, and derive how often that 25ppg/55% Fg/40% 3Pt player shows up each night.  The lack of a consistency metric leads to a lot of speculative opinions about players; ""Player 'X' is good, but he's streaky and has a lot of hot and cold nights.""  Without watching every single game for Player ""X"", or looking at the entire gamelog for a season, it's difficult to have a response to said speculation, without you speculating as well, leading to *an ouroboros of speculation*.  
  
&nbsp;

This morning, I sat down, and went through the entire season of gamelogs for each of the top 20 scorers in the NBA, to provide both myself, as well as you all, with a little bit of clarity on how consistent, and efficient each of those players are.  

&nbsp;

# **Understandings (please read this)**  
There are two very important understandings that must be had, when looking at this data.  They are:

 * Nightly Average Shooting %
 * Standard Deviation (or StDev)

&nbsp;

## **Nightly Average Shooting %**

While this is the ""less complicated"" of the two, I am covering this one first, because I know this one will cause the most confusion.  

&nbsp;

The shooting percentages you see on a stat sheet, are an *average of cumulative metrics*.  The shooting percentages you will see in my tables, do not take this into consideration, because an average of all shots for an entire season doesn't tell you anything about consistency.

&nbsp;

 **Example**
For this example, lets take an imaginary 7 game series (to make this as simple as possible).  In this scenario, lets say Steph Curry had 3Pt shooting nights of:

* 10/10  
* 10/10  
* 0/5  
* 0/2  
* 0/3  
* 0/4  
* 0/5 

&nbsp;

Steph's 3pt shooting percentage of this series would be 20/39, or 51.28%.  If you just looked at that 51.28%, you would think ""*How did the Warriors lose?  Steph shot over 50% from 3!*""  The actual truth would be that **for over half the series, Steph shot very poorly**, he had 2 great games, and 5 bad games.  His **Nightly Average 3pt%** would be 28.57% ( much lower than his series 3Pt% of 51.28%). 

&nbsp; 

## **Standard Deviation (StDev)**  
  
This one is going to be a bit rough, and I'm going to keep it as simple as possible.  Professional data scientists, actual statisticians, and people that are REALLY deep into ""*stonks*"" will know what this is without having to read this section.  
  
&nbsp;

Here is a very layman's explanation of StDev and what you need to know:  
  
 1. StDev is the measurement of volatility of a data set.  Basically, how spread the data is.  
 2. **LOWER IS ALWAYS BETTER when consistency is a concern**  
 3. It's a bit more complicated than this, and without boring you with a lot of math, if you're curious on how StDev works, there are some great YouTube videos that describe it in a very digestible/visual way.  There is no shame in watching them, because even I had to do it, 5 years ago, when I first started using StDev as a method to evaluate data in my primary hobby, astrophotography.  
&nbsp;

## **The Actual Data!**  

*Note 1: This data is sorted by actual PPG, I will have breakdowns of each section below the table*  
*Note 2: Bold means ""leader among the Top 20""*  
*Note 3: Italics means ""worst among the Top 20""*

This list doesn't need a lot of analysis, you can get this list directly from Basketball Reference.  You don't/shouldn't need anyone to break down PPG for you.  If PPG were a TV show, it would be ""The Office"", because everyone can understand it, and everyone quotes it.

I guess all of the ""robotic"" jokes about Kawhi Leonard have some statistical basis.  **Out of all of the top 20 scorers, Kawhi had the greatest chance of bringing every point of that 24.8 PPG to the table each game.**  His season high was 36 points, and his low was 13 points.

&nbsp;

Curry, well, when you carry a team that hard, I guess there will be a lot of fluctuation in your points output.  **His season average was 31.98 (basically 32), and he had 29 games of sub-average performance, and three games where he didn't even score half of his season average.**  His season high was 62 points (18 ft, 8 threes, and 18 buckets overall), and his season low was 11 (2 of 16 shooting for that game).

&nbsp;

I doubt there is much surprise about the top, or the bottom of this list.  Zion is a dunk machine, almost 70% of his shots take place 0-3 feet from the basket, and nobody is going to stop his 284 lbs of fury.  **Ben Simmons, passing out of a wide open dunk, needs to watch some Zion footage.**

&nbsp;

The bottom of this list features two heavy volume shooters in Donovan Mitchell and Trae Young.  While 44% nightly field goal percentage isn't ""bad"", it's not great.  If you look at a lot of Hawks and/or Jazz box scores, you probably already had an inkling that neither of these two folks have an overwhelming amount of efficient nights.  **Mitchell had 10 nights this season where he shot worse than 35%, and Trae said ""*hold my beer*"" with 17 of his own nights (this is over 1/4th of his entire games played this season).**  Mitchell and Young are, at the very minimum, average in their TS+ (Trae being 103 and Mitchell being exactly league average at 100, though his actual TS is below league average .569 to .572), but both definitely struggle with consistent efficiency.

## **FG% (StDev)**

&nbsp;

The top two, and bottom two, tell interesting stories.  Being ""consistent"" isn't always good, but it's also not always bad, it's all about context.  If you're a 25% shooter, you WANT your consistency to be way off, because you don't want to show up, every single night, and give 25% to your team.  **Luka leads the pack here, but it's not as good as Kawhi's efficiency, because Luka is extremely consistent at being averagely efficient (when compared to the top 20 here, as his average nightly Fg% is in the bottom half of this pack).**  Kawhi is in the top 5 for average nightly Fg%, as well as being 2nd on the list of standard deviation among his Fg% data.

&nbsp;

The bottom two, well ""*The Lord giveth, and the Lord taketh away*"".  Zion is, by far, the most efficient on a night by night basis, but due to the fact that his nightly Fg% is so absurdly high, he's going to have a decent amount of games where his Fg% is in the range of mere mortals.  **Zion had an impressive 10 games this season where he shot over 75%, but he also had 31 games this season where he shot below his nightly Fg% (though only 3 games where he was below 45%!).** 

&nbsp;

The Jaylen Brown stats are not that bad, hold those downvotes Celtics fans.  Yes, he's wildly inconsistent when compared to everyone else in this top 20, BUT, he's inconsistent on the good side.  He's 8th in his nightly Fg%, .490, pretty good.  **He had 29 games this season (over half his entire season) where he shot above that mark of .490, including an 85% night (17/20 shooting).**. Yeah, he's a bit erratic, but over half the time when he steps on the court, you're getting the ""*good*"" type of erratic; The type of erratic that John Starks fans loved.

## **Nightly 3pt% (Average)**

 1. Embiid	0.428 
 2. Curry	0.412

&nbsp;

Ok, so yeah... This data set features the least practicable thing I thought I would see today, and the most predictable thing I would see today.  **When I started off this morning (7 hours ago from the moment I am typing this), I did NOT expect to see that Joel Embiid was going to be the most efficient 3Pt shooter out of the entire top 20 scorers in the league (on a night by night basis).** I will explain how this works in the next breakdown, where I talk about 3Pt% StDev.  Worry not Warriors fans, Steph is still the premiere ""*God Tier*"" 3Pt shooter in the league.

&nbsp;

*Exhales...* Let me begin this by saying that I'm a 30+ year Suns fan.  I pre-date the Barkley trade, and have been with them through all of the good, and all of the bad.  When I was stationed in Europe, I would stay up at crazy hours, just so I could root for the Purple and Orange.  I went to games at the Madhouse on McDowell.  With that out of the way: Devin Booker is a very inefficient 3Pt shooter.  As you've seen in the last game (assuming I get this out before this evening's game), he's not a ""*bad*"" 3Pt shooter (he hit a few HUGE threes), but he is rather inefficient on a night-to-night basis.  You don't even have to watch Suns games to understand this either, you can look at the box scores.  **The league average (this season) was .367 from 3, wanna guess how many games Devin spent below the league average?**  39 games (58% of the games he played this season), including 10 games where he was 0% from 3.  

## **3Pt% (StDev)**

 1. Lillard	0.151 
 2. Curry	0.158 
 3. Tatum	0.180 
 4. Doncic	0.188 
 5. LaVine	0.193 
 6. Fox	0.196 
 7. Brown	0.196 
 8. Ingram	0.200 
 9. Mitchell	0.201 
 10. Booker	0.207 
 11. Beal	0.219 
 12. Young	0.221 
 13. Irving	0.223 
 14. Leonard	0.257 
 15. Randle	0.258 
 16. Antetokounmpo	0.259 
 17. Sexton	0.273 
 18. Jokic	0.305 
 19. Embiid	0.337 
 20. Williamson	0.450

&nbsp;

Lets address the open item from the breakdown before this one.  **Embiid is not an elite 3Pt shooter, he just doesn't shoot a lot (for a 3Pt shooter) and he has a decent number (8 to be exact) of 100% nights (where he went 1/1 or 2/2).**   Yes, Book has 10 nights of 0%, but Embiid has 12 nights of the same percentage.  Roughly 24% of the time Joel steps onto the court, he's going to be a complete dud from 3.

&nbsp;

**Steph is still the gold standard when it comes to 3Pt shooting.**  Lillard is on top of this list, meaning that he's the most consistent, but all that means is that he's the most consistent at bringing home a nightly 3Pt% lower than Steph (8% lower, relatively).  Props to Dame, but Curry is the King, all Hail to the Chef.

## **Nightly Ft% (Average)**

 1. Irving	0.923 
 2. Curry	0.914 
 3. Lillard	0.906 
 4. Young	0.891 
 5. Leonard	0.885 
 6. Beal	0.883 
 7. Booker	0.865 
 8. Tatum	0.864 
 9. Ingram	0.860 
 10. LaVine	0.859 
 11. Jokic	0.857 
 12. Embiid	0.849 
 13. Mitchell	0.827 
 14. Sexton	0.816

 16. Brown	0.770 
 17. Doncic	0.728 
 18. Williamson	0.707 
 19. Fox	0.705 
 20. Antetokounmpo	0.683

&nbsp;

Well, it was nice knowing you.  This is likely where everyone checks out, if you haven't checked out already (lets be real, this is a wall of text after all).  Not many folks are going to care about Ft%, except for the diehard stat-heads.

&nbsp;

**Kyrie had a 50/40/90 season (and 36 perfect games), Steph is on the same level as Steve Nash when it comes to free throws (he had 36 as well), and Dame is an elite-level free throw shooter as well (38 perfect games for Dolla).**  Not many surprises here.

&nbsp;

**And coming in at the bottom, the Balkan Brick himself, Giannis.**  To be honest though, it's not nearly as bad as I thought it would be, and he only had 1 game of 0% all year

## **FT% (StDev)**

 1. Young	0.116 
 2. Beal	0.131 
 3. Curry	0.134 
 4. Booker	0.152 
 5. Irving	0.154 
 6. Lillard	0.162 
 7. Williamson	0.162 
 8. Embiid	0.163 
 9. Leonard	0.167 
 10. Fox	0.179 
 11. Sexton	0.179 
 12. Randle	0.183 
 13. Tatum	0.190 
 14. Mitchell	0.193 
 15. Jokic	0.195 
 16. Antetokounmpo	0.195 
 17. LaVine	0.201 
 18. Doncic	0.209 
 19. Ingram	0.217 
 20. Brown	0.260

&nbsp;

I'm on the home stretch.  I'm going to make a PB&J sandwich after this, and it's going to be awesome.

&nbsp;

**The reason why I love Trae Young is specifically this.  Yes, he's pretty inefficient, but the man makes up for it at the line.**  He is an elite Ft shooter, and he's massively consistent at being elite.  His consistency at the line is unparalleled, only having one game of below .667 this entire season (Steph had 4, Dame had 3, Kyrie had 2).  

&nbsp;

**Celtics fans, I don't hate your team, Jaylen Brown is just a weird guy.**  His consistency at the line isn't great, but he also hardly gets there on a night to night basis.  Jaylen had nine games this year where he didn't even get to the line at all.  He had two 0% games, which is double what Giannis, but he also had 20 perfect games.  He plays nothing like John Starks, but his consistency is very reminiscent of him.

## **Conclusions**
**If you take anything away from reading this, please understand that EVERYTHING in basketball is relational.** Someone's PPG doesn't matter, if you don't know the percentages behind it.  Someone's ORTG or DRTG means nothing if you don't know specific components of their game behind said rating (case in point, Robin Lopez once led the league in ORTG, look it up, 2013-2014 season).

**Being consistent is neither good nor bad, without knowing someone's efficiency to begin with.**  Being consistently inefficient is bad, and being inconsistently good is also bad.  They are two wildly different metrics, but they also need each other in order to having any meaning at all.

Yes Foster reffed and there was a free throw discrepancy. But as we saw in Game 1, free throw discrepancies don't tell the whole story. They won't save you if you're shitting the bed.

I'd like to hear how the reffing impacted some of the play, sure, but I doubt Foster is enough to cause a team as good as the Suns to get blown out. So what adjustments both before and during the game did Bud/Monty make that helped or hurt their teams? Were there any significant differences in who played and for how long? Which players had the biggest impact, good or bad? Can the Bucks do what they did last night consistently? 

Disclaimer: This is a question *primarily* for people who are neutral towards the Suns but if you can give a fair answer as a non-neutral fan, I'll take it. It's also for people who watched all 3 games and can break down changes in the Bucks' defensive and offensive strategies beyond 'Giannis is driving to the basket more/less'. I'm looking for ones who know their Xs and Os.

It just makes sense In a lot of ways it didn't come from the NBA instead the other way around. The vast majority of basketball isn't played in the NBA, so it makes sense that a lot of the innovation ends up happening elsewhere.  Nick Nurse and Mike D'Antoni came up with their unusual styles in Europe, a lot of pace and space started in low level college programmes, and the women's game has been hoisting a lot of 3s in recent years As for some of those other things, it depends more. In college it's less likely that you have multiple athletic wings, so switching is harder, and it's harder to find a big with NBA size and ability so often if you have one they will be featured more prominently. Simply because there's a strong chance that the other team doesn't have a player like that In the women's game, size is a bigger advantage than in the men's game. Due to the decreased physical athleticism and speed, it's simply harder to make up for size. A lot more of the game is played through the post, and while many of the women's games best players are guards, it's comparatively harder for them to attack bigs and the offensive shift to perimeter creation has been less drastic The international game is mixed. They often play more through their bigs, partially due to the same reasons above of not having the same athletes on the perimeter, fewer high quality bigs with size, and more physicality on the perimeter. But international play has also long been ahead of the NBA, spread pick and roll was the normal overseas long before the NBA. They often play with a smaller more athletic 5, or a skilled 5 simply because that's what was available and that's what a lot of overseas leagues create",34,0.036,0.875,0.089,0.9418,5.89

Obviously don't know what he would have done because everyone is still navigating the new territory themselves. In terms of who already had UNC offers, I think the only notable one is Jarace Walker. But even then, it never seemed like Roy was recruiting him much. Since Hubert took over I think it's been said there's been no contact though. I guess De'Ante Green is another. Can't remember if the staff cooled on him before or after Roy's retiring. Obviously Kessler transferred but that was happening regardless. The coaching change got him closer to staying more than anything. Outside of those two, there weren't many offers out to begin with. Roy historically was extremely stingy with his offers, and I think covid/these kids not having proper summer basketball really kept him from going after recruits in 2022+ because they couldn't be scouted. I assume the same for is true for every school. Only other major one I can think of is Robert Dillingham and he just visited a couple of days ago so I think we're good.

"CollegeBasketball","Anels0505","NIL could be the best possible thing for College Basketball","2021-01-07 6:27:17 AM","Since the NBA changed their draft eligibility rules in 2006 college basketball has been ruled by the one-and-done stars. From Kevin Durant to Zion Williamson, the sport has become enraptured with players who are essentially biding their time waiting for their opportunity for a paycheck. I don't think anyone is going to claim that a player like KD or Zion would have stayed in college for longer if they were getting paid, but there's a whole other class of player that I think will weigh that decision very differently. 

Examine a player like Dayton's Obi Toppin. He burst onto the scene as a freshman and quickly ascended to stardom. The loss of the 2020 Tournament will forever remain the great what-if for Dayton fans, but what if Toppin could have cashed in on his NPOY season and stayed in college another season or two? Would be be talking about Dayton's Final Four run in the 2021 Tournament? Maybe that's worth more to him than being drafted eighth overall by the Knicks. 

NIL presents an option for star college players to stay in college without having to choose between millions of dollars and absolutely nothing. Sure, one-and-done isn't going away unless the NBA changes their rules, but I do think that giving players the option to cash in on college stardom may incentivize longer stints at the college level. And that is a very good thing for college basketball fans.","t3_obltts","https://www.reddit.com/r/CollegeBasketball/comments/obltts/nil_could_be_the_best_possible_thing_for_college/",111,99,"t1_h3oor6v","2021-01-07 7:20:10 AM","Okay. After putting some thought into this I now have some concerns. Right now some of the different methods we've seen soo far are putting just a few bucks in their pocket, relative of course to the total costs of what their scholarships are worth. But these athletes are going to quickly push the limits of how much they are able to make. What's to say Kentucky's next 5 star recruit immediately gets a shoe deal worth a quarter million dollars? The company might pile too much on that causes his grades to slip, and he becomes ineligible. Because of this he gets no playing time for half the season so NBA teams don't want him because they consider him lazy. So he goes from Lottery pick signing a 14 million dollar contract to late second round league minimum. That shoe deal seems pretty stupid now. Then there is the aspect of what happens when they sign for endorsement money that high, can we really justify spending scholarship money on him when he can afford school out of pocket now?  My idea. The NCAA (not the schools) need to have a dedicated office on each campus staffed my a mix of accounts and lawyers. They take zero dollars if a student get an endorsement deal, but, each student athlete had the majority of those funds in a trust, which is payed out post college, while allowing the student to get a small percentage of the trust paid out either each month, or maybe 2 times a semester, up to a certain amount (say 1500 a month or 6000 a semester? I don't know those sound like good numbers) This way the NCAA can monitor the responsibilities the students have to the companies paying them so they are not over loaded between school, sports, and endorsement deals. This also prevents them from going through the money too fast. Isn't that how the trust fund kids at Harvard do things anyway?",-4,0.02,0.858,0.122,0.9861,2.7199999999999998

"CollegeBasketball","SakPrescott","Interactive ""Power Projection"" Map","2021-09-07 9:27:11 AM","I love checking up on the imperialism maps / the ""remaining undefeated teams"" maps throughout the season, so I've been working on my own version for the coming 2021-22 season: the [CBB ""Power Projection"" Map](https://imgur.com/urkj2Pg) (currently using the latest data from the end of the 2021 season).

In this map, each US county is assigned an ""owner"" based on who has the highest power projection score in that county. This score is calculated for each team in each county by taking their Kenpom Adj. EM and dividing it by the distance between the team's stadium and the nearest county border -- the result is that each county is controlled by the strongest nearby team, allowing teams to expand and protect their ""domain"" by playing better (and thus raising their Adj. EM throughout the season). In order to avoid making it too cluttered, I also imposed a rule that only the top 30 teams (by Adj. EM) could own land; this is pretty arbitrary though so if you think it should be different let me know. 

You can explore the map (and see which non-landed teams are within each team's domain) using this interactive version I made:

> https://werdna63.shinyapps.io/ncaa-maps/#section-power-projection-map

(It should work on mobile, but it's probably going to look a lot better on a desktop / laptop)

It also includes a data viewing tool that lets you view the total land area, water area, population, etc. of each team's ""domain"" (you can even export the tables to a .CSV or a .PDF!). It should update automatically after each game since it draws the data directly from Kenpom.com too!

I'm posting this here now because I wanted to see if anyone had any feedback / recommendations for how I could improve this before the season starts; I also might throw something similar together for college football since that's coming up even sooner. If this is something you think would be fun / if you have any feedback it would be appreciated!","t3_ogz54c","https://www.reddit.com/r/CollegeBasketball/comments/ogz54c/interactive_power_projection_map/",53,30,"t1_h4vp1gj","2021-11-07 7:59:55 PM","I'm a little confused how UCLA pretty much only owns Santa Barbara lol",1,0.118,0.529,0.353,0.6115,5.029999999999999

I then began thinking about the awkward camera angle at the Carrier Dome (no offense, Cuse bros), the weird eye sore courts peppered throughout the nation, the slow paced teams and so on. 


So here's the premise:
What is the most annoying possible total CBB game package?

2) Venue

3) Matchup

4) Offical(s)

5) Commentator(s)

"CollegeBasketball","schu4KSU","Did empty arenas affect Free Throw Percentage this season?","2021-30-06 1:13:56 PM","College Basketball fans love making noise, waving signs, and doing anything they can to distract opposing players at the free throw line.  But without fans in arenas this season, did it make any difference for free throw shooters?  tl;dr: No.

I was curious about this, so I did a quick and unscientific calculation (I'm no statistician).  I got [FT% numbers for every NCAA Division I team](https://www.teamrankings.com/ncaa-basketball/stat/free-throw-pct) for the 2019-20 and 2020-21 seasons and averaged up the team FT%'s to get a proxy estimate of total FT% for each season.

&#x200B;

|Season|Average Team FT%|
|:-|:-|
|2019-20 (with fans)|70.86%|
|2020-21 (without fans)|70.92%|

Empty arenas didn't lead to any significant difference in overall FT%: only a 0.06% improvement, or 6 extra FT Made out of every 10,000 FT Attempted. For a reference point, the average team attempted about 410 free throws total last season, so this all rounds to no change in scoring. 

But what about home/away splits?  Wouldn't we expect to at least see an improvement in road teams' shooting without all those distracting fans behind the basket?

&#x200B;

|Season|Home FT%|Away FT%|Home Advantage|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|2019-20|71.58%|70.24%|\+ 1.34%|
|2020-21|71.39%|70.48%|\+ 0.91%|

Again, very slight, insignificant differences.  Teams' ""home advantage"" slipped a tiny bit, because they shot a tiny bit better on the road (+0.24%, or 2.4 extra FTs made for every 1000 attempts), but also shot a tiny bit worse at home (-0.19%, or 1.9 extra FTs missed for every 1000 attempts).

So, without the screaming, waving, distracting fans in the stands, it looks like road teams scored, on average, roughly one extra made Free Throw over the course of the entire season.  But balancing that out, teams playing without all their home fans silently holding their breath and doing things for good luck missed roughly one extra Free Throw over the season.  So it all washes out in the end.","t3_ob5jkc","https://www.reddit.com/r/CollegeBasketball/comments/ob5jkc/did_empty_arenas_affect_free_throw_percentage/",22,11,"t1_h3lvf0i","2021-30-06 2:14:17 PM","LOVE free throw stats like this. Thank you.   I'd say most of the home FT% advantage is about who is getting fouled.  Home team win more games and, therefore, shoot more very late game FTs.  In those instances, the teams shooting the free throws have more influence on who will be fouled (players with the ball; players on the court).",16,0.031,0.674,0.294,0.9653,6.4399999999999995

In this map, each US county is assigned an ""owner"" based on who has the highest power projection score in that county. This score is calculated for each team in each county by taking their Kenpom Adj. EM and dividing it by the distance between the team's stadium and the nearest county border -- the result is that each county is controlled by the strongest nearby team, allowing teams to expand and protect their ""domain"" by playing better (and thus raising their Adj. EM throughout the season). In order to avoid making it too cluttered, I also imposed a rule that only the top 30 teams (by Adj. EM) could own land; this is pretty arbitrary though so if you think it should be different let me know. 

You can explore the map (and see which non-landed teams are within each team's domain) using this interactive version I made:

> https://werdna63.shinyapps.io/ncaa-maps/#section-power-projection-map

(It should work on mobile, but it's probably going to look a lot better on a desktop / laptop)

It also includes a data viewing tool that lets you view the total land area, water area, population, etc. of each team's ""domain"" (you can even export the tables to a .CSV or a .PDF!). It should update automatically after each game since it draws the data directly from Kenpom.com too!

I'm posting this here now because I wanted to see if anyone had any feedback / recommendations for how I could improve this before the season starts; I also might throw something similar together for college football since that's coming up even sooner.

Using recent statistics to retrodict what would have happened if a major, fundamental change had occurred in the past is lazy, misleading, and often uninformative. So, naturally, I wanted to find out what the (Division I Men's) college basketball landscape might look like if it had a promotion/relegation system exactly the same as the English Football Pyramid.

&#x200B;

The English pyramid scheme promises 7,000+ teams that they could win the national title in within 11 years or so if they just do well enough, but the champion winds up being the same 5 or 6 teams all the time.  I figure college basketball has got to be more volatile than that, right?  So this could be interesting?

&#x200B;

I used the Massey College Basketball Ranking Composite from the final week of each year to retrodict how well each team would do compared to the other teams in their league, with teams then promoted/relegated according to the current rules of the English pyramid scheme, with the exception that we only need 8 levels instead of 11 to cover all of the Division I Men's Basketball teams.  For college hoops, Massey only goes back to the 2002-03 season, so I used that year to determine which of the 15 leagues in the 8 different levels each team gets to start, and I'm only retrodicting starting with the 2003-04 season.  This is clearly the best time period to use, the best ranking to use, the best promotion/relegation system to use, and the best way to determine the starting position for each team, and anyone who disagrees with me isn't worth arguing against, because they have no grasp of written sarcasm.

&#x200B;

Using this method, the actual, real-life champion of the NCAA Tournament each year would have been competing in the top league every year except for the infamously wild 2011 tournament, when UConn would have been in the second-best league.  OK, that's not 100% true - UNC got a rough starting spot in the third level in 2003-04 and didn't have enough time to make it to the top league for their tourney win the next year, but that's a weird artifact of how I chose the starting positions and not a reflection on the parity of college basketball.  When everything settled down, it seemed that only maybe 20 teams out of 350+ are realistically capable of winning the tourney in any given year, or maybe 25 in really wild years without strong top teams.  Less than 10% of the teams competing.  Doesn't seem great... until you compare it with the English football.

&#x200B;

51 basketball teams would spend time in the top level of our fantasy realm, with 12 of them winning the top league at some point in the 18 year period.  The actual Premier League featured only 41 teams over the same time period, with only 6 of them winning the league, including the once-in-a-generation accomplishment of underdogs Leicester City.  So college basketball tends to have more teams in with a chance at a championship any given year and to rotate those teams out from year-to-year more often than English football.  I show a comparison below, with teams currently in the top league going into 2021-22 highlighted in green.  And if you look across the row, you might find a soccer team that can torture you in the same way as your basketball team!  Isn't cross-cultural misery wonderful?

&#x200B;

Of course, there is another way to compare parity between these two sports.  In England, only the top 90ish teams are fully professional.  So, instead of comparing the 350 Division I teams giving out scholarships to all 7,000+ soccer teams in England, maybe it's more fair to compare them to just the professional teams?  In England, 6 of the top 92 teams have a realistic shot at the title.  That's 6.5%, and 6.5% of 350 teams is about 23 teams... so do we actually have as much parity, within the whole of Division I, as English football?  Do we just think we have more parity because we have more teams, and never think about any team (other than our own) outside the top 100?  Something to think about.

&#x200B;

But with more teams in general, and still only one champion, there is more mystery and intrigue about who will be champion in any given year.  And it's more exciting to have a tournament that any team could qualify for, where teams without title hopes could still pull off the upset of the century that they can remember more fondly than the top teams recall a championship a decade ago!  We can ignore that England also does this exact same thing in their Cup competitions and put off consideration of the extent to which innately unevenly distributed resources translates into sporting success independent of sport or tactics for another day, since this post is already long enough.

It's a new day in college athletics. What began as a long and slow process to allow college athletes to profit off the use of their Name, Image, and Likeness rapidly evolved over the last few months from changes in state laws and the recent Supreme Court decision.

Beginning today, the NCAA has implemented an interim policy suspending the eligibility rules surrounding NIL while working with Congress to develop a national standard.

We're expecting boatloads of major bag alerts from players and schools over the coming days. We ask that those announcements be posted in the megathread, while anything that is nationally newsworthy can still have it's own post.

Thanks everyone and happy NIL Day!

Here it is: Terrence Roberts: NCAA should restore Jim Boeheim’s vacated wins because of new NIL rules Updated 6:24 PM; Today 9:30 AM Terrence Roberts SU's Terrence Roberts fires up the record crowd in the Carrier Dome late in the game against Notre Dame. By Mike Waters | mwaters@syracuse.com 1,626 shares Syracuse, N.Y. ― In 2005, Syracuse basketball players Terrence Roberts and Hakim Warrick attended a summer basketball tournament at the Tri-Valley YMCA in Oneida. From 2004 to 2007, Roberts and another former SU player Billy Edelin received payments from the Oneida YMCA for mentoring kids and performing other duties such as working the clock at a basketball game. Under new NCAA rules allowing college athletes the right to profit off their own name, image and likeness, Roberts, Warrick and Edelin would be able to earn money for appearing at summer camps. But in 2015, after a years-long investigation into the Syracuse basketball program, the NCAA hit Syracuse with sanctions that included probation, a loss of scholarships, a reduction in recruiting visits on top of the school’s self-imposed one-year ban from the NCAA tournament. The NCAA also vacated a number of wins from SU coach Jim Boeheim’s record, including 45 directly related to Roberts’ work at the YMCA in Oneida. Roberts said he’s glad to see the NCAA changing its stance on athletes benefitting from their popularity. “They are making a living off of policing us and more than half the time we are starving watching the system get fat off our backs,’' Roberts said. “The tides are turning and I love every bit of it.’' Roberts has always maintained that he did nothing wrong in his limited work with the Tri-Valley YMCA. He insists that he went through the school’s compliance department. He chafes at the notion that he cost Boeheim to lose 45 wins. “I did my part,’' Roberts said. “I filed all the correct paperwork at the time, so whatever happened or didn’t happen was with compliance not doing the proper follow-ups and filing the right paperwork to make sure we were all clear. I did my part to make sure we were good and I was told we were good.’' Syracuse won 23 games in the 2005-06 season. Roberts appeared in all of the wins. The NCAA vacated every one of the wins. In the 2006-07 season, Syracuse went 24-11. Roberts played in 33 games, missing two games that Syracuse won due to an injury. The NCAA vacated 22 wins from the SU record books. The NCAA also took away 15 wins from Syracuse as a result of Edelin’s appearances in the 2004-05 season. That’s a total of 60 wins. (The 41 remaining vacated wins came from academic improprieties that the NCAA found from 2010 to 2012). Roberts said he thinks the NCAA should restore the wins that were vacated as a result of the payments that were illegal then but would be now allowed under the NCAA’s new NIL rules “Jim Boeheim has worked too long and too hard to have his -- and our -- wins stripped on a technicality,’' Roberts said. Boeheim currently ranks second in all-time NCAA coaching victories with 982. Duke’s Mike Krzyzewski is the NCAA’s all-time with 1,170 wins. But restore the 60 wins resulting from the payments that were illegal then but would be OK now under the NCAA’s new NIL rules, and the gap between Krzyzewski and Boeheim shrinks from 188 to 128. Roberts said he has never talked with Boeheim about the NCAA’s penalty and his role in the vacated wins. “I never wanted to bother him with what I felt about it because at the end of the day he lost a lot more than I did,’' Roberts said. “He is and was under a lot more pressure than I ever will be.’' Loading video Contact Mike Waters anytime: Email | Twitter MORE ORANGE BASKETBALL Get your Buddy Buckets gear: SU’s Buddy Boeheim signs deal with The Players Trunk John Wildhack details Syracuse’s NIL plan on logo use, pre-approval, more.

Namely the NIL and transfer rules. We're entering an entirely new era of college basketball (and colleges athletics in general) and Roy would have had to adapt to that. Obviously don't know what he would have done because everyone is still navigating the new territory themselves. In terms of who already had UNC offers, I think the only notable one is Jarace Walker. But even then, it never seemed like Roy was recruiting him much. Since Hubert took over I think it's been said there's been no contact though. I guess De'Ante Green is another. Can't remember if the staff cooled on him before or after Roy's retiring. Obviously Kessler transferred but that was happening regardless. The coaching change got him closer to staying more than anything. Outside of those two, there weren't many offers out to begin with. Roy historically was extremely stingy with his offers, and I think covid/these kids not having proper summer basketball really kept him from going after recruits in 2022+ because they couldn't be scouted. I assume the same for is true for every school. Only other major one I can think of is Robert Dillingham and he just visited a couple of days ago so I think we're good.

But without fans in arenas this season, did it make any difference for free throw shooters?  tl;dr: No.

I was curious about this, so I did a quick and unscientific calculation (I'm no statistician).  I got [FT% numbers for every NCAA Division I team](https://www.teamrankings.com/ncaa-basketball/stat/free-throw-pct) for the 2019-20 and 2020-21 seasons and averaged up the team FT%'s to get a proxy estimate of total FT% for each season.

&#x200B;

|Season|Average Team FT%|
|:-|:-|
|2019-20 (with fans)|70.86%|
|2020-21 (without fans)|70.92%|

Empty arenas didn't lead to any significant difference in overall FT%: only a 0.06% improvement, or 6 extra FT Made out of every 10,000 FT Attempted. For a reference point, the average team attempted about 410 free throws total last season, so this all rounds to no change in scoring. 

But what about home/away splits?  Wouldn't we expect to at least see an improvement in road teams' shooting without all those distracting fans behind the basket?

&#x200B;

|Season|Home FT%|Away FT%|Home Advantage|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|2019-20|71.58%|70.24%|\+ 1.34%|
|2020-21|71.39%|70.48%|\+ 0.91%|

Again, very slight, insignificant differences.  Teams' ""home advantage"" slipped a tiny bit, because they shot a tiny bit better on the road (+0.24%, or 2.4 extra FTs made for every 1000 attempts), but also shot a tiny bit worse at home (-0.19%, or 1.9 extra FTs missed for every 1000 attempts).

So, without the screaming, waving, distracting fans in the stands, it looks like road teams scored, on average, roughly one extra made Free Throw over the course of the entire season.  But balancing that out, teams playing without all their home fans silently holding their breath and doing things for good luck missed roughly one extra Free Throw over the season.  So it all washes out in the end.","t3_ob5jkc","https://www.reddit.com/r/CollegeBasketball/comments/ob5jkc/did_empty_arenas_affect_free_throw_percentage/",21,11,"t1_h3lvf0i","2021-30-06 2:14:17 PM","LOVE free throw stats like this. Thank you.   I'd say most of the home FT% advantage is about who is getting fouled.  Home team win more games and, therefore, shoot more very late game FTs.  In those instances, the teams shooting the free throws have more influence on who will be fouled (players with the ball; players on the court).",17,0.031,0.674,0.294,0.9653,6.4399999999999995

Obviously that is an extremely crowded space, especially in a topic that so many people have interest in and dream of working in. If you went this route, I think the key is obviously producing unique content that would maybe fill an underserved niche. Maybe focusing on a conference that doesn't get a lot of coverage, unique player content, etc. If you just tried to create a site talking about the top D1 teams you'll get drowned out by much bigger and established sources. To find an audience in today's world requires finding angles that aren't already overcrowded. Also, thinking about NIL could be a good way to go since it is so new and sort of a goldrush.

On that day, Adams was the first one in the program to learn of Beard’s plan, because Beard called him early that morning, inviting him over to his house. Beard was well aware of Adams’ value. He informed him he was taking the Texas job, and he wanted Adams to come with him. There would be a team meeting 45 minutes later, and then they’d board a plane at 1 p.m. Adams felt a strong loyalty to Beard. Beard gave him a lifeline in 2015 when Adams was in a non-coaching role at Texas Tech, and he brought him along to Arkansas Little Rock to be his assistant and run his defense. But Adams didn’t commit to the initial invitation to go to Austin, and after the team meeting, Beard immediately doubled back, pulling him aside to ask him again if he’d join him on the plane. But as the process played out over the week after Beard bolted, Tech athletic director Kirby Hocutt figured out that Adams’ impact in Lubbock was even greater than he realized. Former and current players called and gave their endorsement, expressing how close they felt to Adams. McCullar, who has dealt with multiple injuries throughout his career, says Adams was always available to lean on and would visit him every day in the training room whenever he was sidelined, checking on him and praying together. “I was really closer with him than I was Coach Beard,” McCullar says. The most powerful message came from Terrance Shannon, the sophomore wing who had already put his name in the NBA Draft. “If I’m going to play another year of college basketball,” Shannon told Hocutt, “the only man I’d play for is Mark Adams.”* *If all that wasn’t enough, a surprise phone call justified the way Hocutt was already leaning. Tony Hernandez, Texas Tech’s deputy director of athletics, got a call from Glenn Sugiyama, who runs the search firm DHR out of Chicago. Texas Tech had not hired his firm to handle the search, but Sugiyama still felt compelled to let Texas Tech know what it had in Adams. Sugiyama had done his homework on Adams two years ago when he’d help the Chicago Bulls try to pursue Adams to be an assistant and coach their defense. Tech convinced him to stay by making him the highest-paid Big 12 assistant, but the process allowed Sugiyama to see his value. “Let me save y’all a lot of time and energy,” Sugiyama told Hernandez. “You need to hire Mark Adams. He’s one of the best basketball minds that people are not aware of.” “Let me save y’all a lot of time and energy,” Sugiyama told Hernandez. “You need to hire Mark Adams. He’s one of the best basketball minds that people are not aware of.”* *Adams wants to play fast, learning from what’s hard for his defense to stop. He knows what you’re thinking. Every new coach says this to appease fans and recruits. But his desire seems to pass the BS sniff test. He convinced Barret Peery to leave his job as head coach at Portland State to help him, a sign that Adams is actually committed to the fast-pace cause. (Portland State finished in the top 40 in pace in two of Peery’s four seasons there.) Adams and his staff have also had video conferences with multiple NBA teams about space-and-pace philosophies, and he’s consulted Northwest Missouri State coach Ben McCollum, whose offense Adams says is game-changing in the way they screen and use angles. McCollum’s teams have won three of the last four Division II national titles.* *No one knows how the fire burns in Adams and Beard better than Sean Sutton, who had to play mediator between the two because his spot on the bench the last four years was sandwiched between Adams and Beard. A regular scene during games, Sutton says, would be Beard turning to Adams and telling him the opposing coach was kicking his side’s ass. Adams’ retort: “Think we could get a basket?”. “Both highly competitive people,” Sutton says. “Both strong-minded.” Sutton has been around the league a long time, playing for his dad at Oklahoma State and then spending 15 years in Stillwater as a coach. He is one of two staff members who stayed with Adams, and he does not hold back on why he put his faith in Adams. “The reason for our success, the reason we were in the national championship game, the reason we were in the Elite Eight, the reason we won a Big 12 championship is because of our defense,” Sutton says. “That’s been the staple. That’s been the most consistent thing about our program — that and probably competing and playing as hard as anybody in the country, which Coach Beard and Coach Adams both deserve credit for. And don’t take anything away from the players. We’ve had really good players, too.*",27,0.024,0.831,0.144,0.9987,3.44

Obviously don't know what he would have done because everyone is still navigating the new territory themselves. In terms of who already had UNC offers, I think the only notable one is Jarace Walker. But even then, it never seemed like Roy was recruiting him much. Since Hubert took over I think it's been said there's been no contact though. I guess De'Ante Green is another. Can't remember if the staff cooled on him before or after Roy's retiring. Obviously Kessler transferred but that was happening regardless. The coaching change got him closer to staying more than anything. Outside of those two, there weren't many offers out to begin with. Roy historically was extremely stingy with his offers, and I think covid/these kids not having proper summer basketball really kept him from going after recruits in 2022+ because they couldn't be scouted. I assume the same for is true for every school. Only other major one I can think of is Robert Dillingham and he just visited a couple of days ago so I think we're good.

If you ignore the condition that you have to play in the games (you can just sit on the bench and take credit for the win), there’s an inside Carolina thread implying that Stillman White, the stormin Mormon, is our winningest tournament player. He was on the team in 2012 (led us past Ohio in the sweet 16 after Creighton broke Kendall Marshall), then left for a two year long mission missing two second round exits, and then played 2015-2017 for another sweet 16, a finals run, and a title. That’s 2+2+5+6=15 tournament wins, for an average of almost a final 4. EDIT: the best consecutive string of years I can find other than 06-09 (although I didn’t check tournaments before 85) is 95-98 at 13 wins (4+1+4+4) which doesn’t beat Danny.

I think the wider lane would help a little bit with spacing inside and to open up offenses a bit, particularly with drives to the hoop.

Also, the shot clock is what every high level competition globally is doing. It's what is used in Canada's college level. 30 is better than 35 in terms of pace but seeing the Canadian and American kids handle the pace of 24 second possessions, I don't think moving it is a detriment to the game.

I know moving to halves might be a bridge too far given TV concerns but I don't think the shot clock or lane width would be huge jumps for the game.","t3_oi9394","https://www.reddit.com/r/CollegeBasketball/comments/oi9394/watching_the_fiba_u19_tourney_i_think_its_time/",261,58,"t1_h4wda1x","2021-12-07 1:07:45 AM","Screw the 24 second clock.

But without fans in arenas this season, did it make any difference for free throw shooters?  tl;dr: No.

I was curious about this, so I did a quick and unscientific calculation (I'm no statistician).  I got [FT% numbers for every NCAA Division I team](https://www.teamrankings.com/ncaa-basketball/stat/free-throw-pct) for the 2019-20 and 2020-21 seasons and averaged up the team FT%'s to get a proxy estimate of total FT% for each season.

&#x200B;

|Season|Average Team FT%|
|:-|:-|
|2019-20 (with fans)|70.86%|
|2020-21 (without fans)|70.92%|

Empty arenas didn't lead to any significant difference in overall FT%: only a 0.06% improvement, or 6 extra FT Made out of every 10,000 FT Attempted. For a reference point, the average team attempted about 410 free throws total last season, so this all rounds to no change in scoring. 

But what about home/away splits?  Wouldn't we expect to at least see an improvement in road teams' shooting without all those distracting fans behind the basket?

&#x200B;

|Season|Home FT%|Away FT%|Home Advantage|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|2019-20|71.58%|70.24%|\+ 1.34%|
|2020-21|71.39%|70.48%|\+ 0.91%|

Again, very slight, insignificant differences.  Teams' ""home advantage"" slipped a tiny bit, because they shot a tiny bit better on the road (+0.24%, or 2.4 extra FTs made for every 1000 attempts), but also shot a tiny bit worse at home (-0.19%, or 1.9 extra FTs missed for every 1000 attempts).

So, without the screaming, waving, distracting fans in the stands, it looks like road teams scored, on average, roughly one extra made Free Throw over the course of the entire season.  But balancing that out, teams playing without all their home fans silently holding their breath and doing things for good luck missed roughly one extra Free Throw over the season.  So it all washes out in the end.","t3_ob5jkc","https://www.reddit.com/r/CollegeBasketball/comments/ob5jkc/did_empty_arenas_affect_free_throw_percentage/",22,11,"t1_h3lvf0i","2021-30-06 2:14:17 PM","LOVE free throw stats like this. Thank you.   I'd say most of the home FT% advantage is about who is getting fouled.  Home team win more games and, therefore, shoot more very late game FTs.  In those instances, the teams shooting the free throws have more influence on who will be fouled (players with the ball; players on the court).",15,0.031,0.674,0.294,0.9653,6.4399999999999995

|2019-20 (with fans)|70.86%|
|2020-21 (without fans)|70.92%|

Empty arenas didn't lead to any significant difference in overall FT%: only a 0.06% improvement, or 6 extra FT Made out of every 10,000 FT Attempted. For a reference point, the average team attempted about 410 free throws total last season, so this all rounds to no change in scoring. 

But what about home/away splits?  Wouldn't we expect to at least see an improvement in road teams' shooting without all those distracting fans behind the basket?

&#x200B;

|Season|Home FT%|Away FT%|Home Advantage|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|2019-20|71.58%|70.24%|\+ 1.34%|
|2020-21|71.39%|70.48%|\+ 0.91%|

Again, very slight, insignificant differences.  Teams' ""home advantage"" slipped a tiny bit, because they shot a tiny bit better on the road (+0.24%, or 2.4 extra FTs made for every 1000 attempts), but also shot a tiny bit worse at home (-0.19%, or 1.9 extra FTs missed for every 1000 attempts).

So, without the screaming, waving, distracting fans in the stands, it looks like road teams scored, on average, roughly one extra made Free Throw over the course of the entire season.  But balancing that out, teams playing without all their home fans silently holding their breath and doing things for good luck missed roughly one extra Free Throw over the season.  So it all washes out in the end.","t3_ob5jkc","https://www.reddit.com/r/CollegeBasketball/comments/ob5jkc/did_empty_arenas_affect_free_throw_percentage/",22,11,"t1_h3lns9w","2021-30-06 1:18:35 PM","My second flair doesn’t like this question",6,0,0.706,0.294,0.3612,4.4399999999999995

I am personally excited about Colorado State (with a bit of bias I must confess). They are carrying a bit of momentum from last season and return all 5 starters, as well as D2 All-American Chandler Jacobs. I think they have a good shot at the MW title next season or at the very least top 3 and I think they will make a strong push and make the tourney as an 8-11 seed.

I am also really excited to see what Patrick Baldwin Jr will do at Milwaukee. He has so much talent and it will be really cool to see some attention brought to a program that usually doesn't receive it.

1) the schools don't share a conference

2) the schools don't share a state

3) the schools aren't ""State U"" of two bordering states. (So no Illinois-Missouri or Indiana-Kentucky)

Furthermore, we agreed that to be considered a ""rivalry"", the schools have to schedule each other more often than not (or have done so in the not-so-recent past), and that fans of one school have to have a ""hope they lose every game"" mentality about the other school, vs. an ""I root for them as long as they're not playing us"" approach. No friendly rivalries allowed. (Though it's fine if the hate is mostly one-sided.)

I said Pitt-WVU, but he said that shouldn't really count because they used to share a conference and if you consider Pitt a ""State U"", which is arguable, then it's a border rivalry.

He said UNC-Kentucky, but I said that shouldn't really count because, well, *everyone* who isn't a UK or UNC fan hates those schools and wants them to lose every game. Plus Kentucky used to be part of Virginia, and Virginia and North Carolina share a border.

I'm sure there are some good ones among smaller schools that we're overlooking.","t3_ogezr8","https://www.reddit.com/r/CollegeBasketball/comments/ogezr8/best_nonconference_outofstate_rivalries_in/",9,73,"t1_h4jeekk","2021-08-07 5:47:59 PM","Virginia vs Maryland",1,0,1,0,0,1.5

Obviously the NBA subsidizes its female counterpart, but for how long?

With the recent pandemic, the NBA economy took a blunt hit and some teams are still suffering from the aftermath, as the league missed its projected revenue by $1.5 billion (!) in 2020. So it's safe to say the commissioner's hand will surely be tighter with cash for the foreseeable future, even though $10 million is essentially chump change by NBA standards.

But the more interesting question is why?

Why does the NBA still ever-so-mercifully allow the WNBA to exist? The latter's ratings are dwindling, players are always in conflict with the leadership and are constantly expressing their frustrations with unfair CBA agreements and stipulations that lead to lower percentages of revenue than their male counterparts. Isn't all of that too much of a burden for all parties concerned? Or is the WNBA just an expensive marketing tool for the league to be branded as an open-to-all, global sports conglomerate, which is part of Silver's ""global game"" philosophy, as we've seen with the expanding fanbases in Asia (especially the Philippines), Europe and North Africa?

"nbadiscussion","deejpro11","Kawhi to the Hawks in FA?","2021-27-06 4:14:10 PM","If Kawhi decides to test the market in Free Agency this summer, I think the Hawks should definitely be on his radar. Here are some reasons why.

1. The Hawks don’t have to give up too much to get him. As it stands now, in order to clear enough cap space to give him the max (~$39.35 mil.), the Hawks would only have to renounce all their cap holds (including John Collins’), and dump the salaries of Gallo, Kris Dunn, and Bruno Fernando; sending those contracts and a 2nd-rounder or two to OKC probably does the job. 

That isn’t nothing — Gallo and John Collins are good players — but that doesn’t compare to Kawhi’s value, and the Hawks get to keep their young wings (Reddish, Huerter, and Hunter) and their 1st for this year.


2. The Hawks have the pieces to build a contender right now. As is, the Hawks’ core of Young, Hunter, Bogdanovic, Huerter, Capela, and Reddish are already pretty good, and have proven that the playoffs aren’t too big for them. Adding Leonard makes the Hawks true title contenders, and that’s before them rounding out their roster with vet Free Agents using their MLE and BAE. The Hawks could realistically field a lineup of

PG: Young
SG: Bogdanovic
SF: Hunter
PF: Leonard
C:  Capela 

with a second unit of 

PG: Ish Smith
SG: Huerter
SF: Reddish
PF: Bobby Portis
C: Okongwu / Vet Min. Big

That team is deep, versatile, and well-rounded: a good mix for playoff basketball. Note also that Nate McMillan seems perfectly capable as a coach and should be the Hawks HC long-term, which is a plus.


3. The Hawks have the flexibility to trade for a disgruntled star next year, and that could truly make them special. Unlike most other teams contending for titles, the Hawks have good young players on cheap contracts for next year, and have all of their draft picks. 

If a star like Bradley Beal or Zach Lavine demands a trade, the Atlanta Hawks can outbid other teams in order to acquire them via trade. They could really sweeten the pot with multiple young players, numerous first round picks, and an established vet while still being a title contender worthy of a star player’s respect and time. 

That’s something that the Clippers and many other contenders can’t do, which makes them significantly less capable of improving their rosters substantially. This is what makes the Hawks uniquely good as a free agent landing spot. Adding a third star to Trae Young and Kawhi Leonard in 2022 would be entirely possible and would make the Hawks a true force in the NBA for years to come.


Ultimately, I don’t think this will happen at all, but the Hawks have a lot to offer for Kawhi and would be a good destination for him. What do y’all think?

Note: I’m using Spotrac for the salary cap numbers.","t3_o97ye8","https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/o97ye8/kawhi_to_the_hawks_in_fa/",0,8,"t1_h39ttb2","2021-27-06 6:16:00 PM","As an OKC fan, I have some thoughts: -Rational me thinks this is relatively unlikely, regardless of how unknowable Kawhi’s motivations/desires were, or any level of upset at how his current knee injury was handled. Odds are on him returning for his max. -Irrational OKC fan in me absolutely wants to see him leave for anywhere (ATL, MIA, NYK, wherever, hell let him go back to SAS for no apparent reason), and start the LAC decline immediately. -Normally I’d say you’d have to give up at least a 1st to get off those contracts, but considering the immediate value added to the LAC picks, Presti probably just asks for their ‘22 pick back and moves Gallo for a 1st elsewhere. -I’d love to see the backup plan rolled out for LAC if Kawhi leaves. Does PG ask for a trade? I don’t think they can create cap space which rules out a big deal for Lowry or one of the bigger FA’s. They can only trade their ‘28 1st and 2nd and that might be enough to get off Morris or Kennard but not both. I’ll end with it’s a nice dream for OKC and ATL but it’s probably not happening",2,0.06,0.841,0.098,0.9039,3.48

Because I genuinely believe that 2014 spurs team could defend any recent dynasty besides warriors with kd, which I even think would go to a 5-6 game win to warriors. I also think they could defend even one of the later bulls teams in the 90s.

The 2014 spurs had a better bench than 2015 warriors imo and had defenders that could slow down their guards. 2015 warriors mimicked the 2014 spurs passing, but it wasnt as good as the 2014 spurs.

Because it was Steph's breakout year, people forget how good that team's defense was. Your team could be up on them by 15 points and they would erase it in 3 minutes by getting stop after stop and then running down to shoot a transition three. That Spurs teams did not face a great defense in their 2014 run. The Warriors switching lineup -- Green, Barnes, Iguodala, Thompson, Curry -- would negate a lot of what the Spurs want to do on offense, it would force Parker, Manu to play more of an iso style.  And the Spurs defense in 2014 wasn't particularly elite. They had some great individual defenders but they couldn't have played a switching style with Duncan. Parker, Diaw, Bellinelli were all pretty questionable. They won with offense that season.

I dont know how they could get that, maybe through the draft, maybe through free agency, maybe through a big blockbuster trade but if the pacers just had one superstar, i believe they could be contenders.

But I also believe the same thing wouldnt be true for other teams. For example, if the timberwolves had giannis, or if the cavs brought back lebron, i dont think theyd be contenders. the pacers in my opinion just have all the right pieces that could easily be built around a star guard who can pass and shoot the pill like guys like  trae or lillard. lillard is on the market this year, but i think the pacers would have to give up sabonis and that 13th pick and a lot of other assets to pick him up, so i dont know if it would be worth it. lemme know what you think in the comments tho.","t3_oc2end","https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/oc2end/the_pacers_are_a_star_away_from_a_championship/",10,15,"t1_h3rnfge","2021-01-07 9:25:05 PM","Sabonis and Turner can’t really play together.

LeVert at SG also is not a good shooter, so they have to somewhat address this. Warren is more of an iso scorer, but that doesn’t fit great with Sabonis/Brogdon/Levert who need the ball. Warren actually is a great 4 option IMO with Turner at the 5 (like in the bubble when Sabonis was hurt), but he’s not really a modern day NBA 3 with Sabonis/Turner at the 4/5 (you would rather have a Mikal Bridges like player at that position - see Suns this year).

I think you have to put Ben at Center in order for him to be playable in the playoffs. I think if you put him with a point guard like Dame and let Ben play Center, with a Mike D’antoni fast paced system. You are going to take all the pressure off of Ben Simmons and let him do what he do best which is play making and play defence. On offence you will have a great high post play maker like a Marc Gasol, then on the defence end you will have a big that can switch on to D up small point or shooting guards. The best thing is that he doesn’t need to have a jump shot, just needs a free throw. He doesn’t need to improved rather just do good on the things he already great at. I think this is the best situation for Ben Simmons to be useful in the playoffs

The 5 Biggest Stock Risers During These NBA Playoffs

The NBA is interesting because during the regular season, fans and media members overreact to players’ performances and form their “player rankings”, only for the playoffs to come around and completely dismantle the aforementioned ranking system. I say this to make the point that when we TRULY think about who the best players in the world are, we need to more heavily consider what they do in May, June and July as opposed to what they do when half of the teams are load managing. For example, take a guy like Julius Randle. He made 3rd team all-NBA (as he should have) because he had a remarkable regular season, leading a Knicks team that played their hearts out in all 72 of their games and earned a 4 seed in the competitive Eastern Conference. However, when the playoff came around and the intensity was heightened, Randle didn’t look like himself. He couldn’t overpower people in the paint anymore, he didn’t create as much space to shoot his mid-range, and he didn’t shoot the ball well from anywhere on the court. Randle is a great player, but he’s not a top 15 NBA player yet - not even close - and it’s because of what he’s done (or hasn’t done) in the most important games that an NBA player can play. Playoff games. 

Note: When ranking the biggest playoff stock risers, I’m considering two main components: 

1) How much better the player performs in the playoffs as opposed to the regular season and 

2) How much more recognition a player gets during the playoffs as opposed to during the regular season (most often a result of a certain team not playing many nationally televised games or not playing in a big market, among other reasons).

5) Kevin Huerter

Kevin Huerter’s rise is definitely a testament in part to the 2nd ranking criteria; he plays in a small market (ATL) and is an unassuming, young player who was drafted in the same draft as Trae Young (and therefore has been overshadowed in the early part of his career). However, this man can flat out BALL, and it’s been a pleasure to watch him flourish in these playoffs. First of all, he’s 6 foot 7 and a good athlete. Yes, a good athlete. He gets super high on his jump shot, and it allows him to EASILY get shots up on shorter players, both out of the post and in the pick and roll; if you didn’t get a chance to watch ATL-PHI game 7, check out Huerter’s highlights from that game in which he absolutely exposes the Sixers (specifically Seth Curry) in the mid-range. He doesn’t just have the pull-up in his bag, though, he also has an underrated handle which allows him to get to multiple different spots on the court. We’ve seen him defended by some of the best defenders in the league during these playoffs (Jrue Holiday and Ben Simmons) and still be able to handle the rock under pressure and physicality. The ability to get to spots in the mid range and rise up to hit shots consistently is something that’s sustainable to build an offensive game around (we’ve seen guys like Beal, Booker, Durant, Middleton, and MANY OTHERS do it already), and Huerter is in an excellent position to do it as well, especially considering he’s only 22 years old. Huerter has also shown a solid ability to make plays for others. He has a high level understanding of offense and is always decisive and confident in his moves and passes, allowing him to be a secondary playmaker for the Hawks during this postseason. If you diligently watched the Hawks this postseason, you’ve probably seen a few of his cross court, lefty passes off the dribble. That’s high level stuff. Finally, Huerter plays on BOTH ENDS of the court! He’s shown some incredible fight while having to defend the likes of Tobias Harris, Ben Simmons, Jrue Holiday, Khris Middleton, and many other talented offensive players. He’s just a really good athlete with long arms who plays his butt off on that end and isn’t afraid to be physical and put his body on the line.  

4) Cameron Payne 

Cam Payne’s first claim to fame in the NBA was for his pregame dance routines with Russell Westbrook. Also, he was literally playing in China 2 years ago, and on multiple D-League teams before that, so it’s safe to say he definitely wasn’t on the average NBA fan’s radar prior to this postseason. He’s had an unbelievable turnaround, though, and he is about to get absolutely paid when he becomes a free agent next season. Payne has this special bounce in his step that I haven’t really seen before; he looks like he could be shot out of a cannon at any point and glide his way to the hoop. He’s also got a really nice floater game around the basket, and he can finish athletically with both hands and with control of his body at the rim. He pairs this with fantastic vision and a 6 foot 7 (!) wingspan, which makes him an unbelievable offensive threat. Before game 6 of the WCF (where CP3 assured all doubters that he is indeed the point God), there was a very persuasive case to be made that Cam Payne had been more effective than Chris Paul against LAC. This is because when CP3 was out of the lineup due to Covid, Payne took his game to a whole new level. We saw a confidence and comfortability that we hadn’t seen before with him, probably because he finally got the start and played big, important minutes. I had thought that maybe he would lose that bounce in his step over the course of a 48 minutes game if he was tasked with playing starting point guard minutes. Perhaps, I had thought, he was only that energetic because he comes in for 6 minute bursts. Well, I was dead wrong. Payne was as spry as he’s looked throughout these entire playoffs in games 1 and 2 of the WCF against LAC, and it has most definitely earned him a starting point guard spot in his near future, whether it be with Phoenix or another team. He’s going to get offered big money from an organization in free agency, much like Terry Rozier was offered a massive contract by the Hornets after his huge playoff performance with the Celtics in their 2018 playoff run to the conference finals. Payne has proven himself to be an impact player who deserves a firm spot in an NBA starting lineup, as well as a much larger contract than his current one (2 years, $2.1mil). The days of Cam Payne being “the guy who dances” are over, and he’s here to stay. He’ll be dancing ON the court from now on... 

3) Dillon Brooks

I must admit that I’m definitely considering the play-in games in conjunction with the playoff games when ranking these players, whether that’s logical or not. But guess what? I’m writing the article, so there’s unfortunately nothing you can do about it, unless you’d like to leave me a nasty comment at the bottom of this article. If Brooks and the Grizzlies had somehow found a way to surpass the Jazz, and Brooks had continued playing the way he was, there’s a very real possibility that Brooks would have been number one on this list. The Dillon Brooks that we saw in both the play-ins and the play-offs is a two way STUD that we didn’t have the pleasure of witnessing during the regular season nearly enough due to him playing in Memphis and therefore being overshadowed by both Ja and Jonas, not to mention playing in a small market. He’s got one of the better motors I’ve seen in the NBA, and it allows him to be a pest on defense like not many others can. He guards the best player on the other team in virtually every game MEM plays, and he WANTS IT, too. He loves the competition, he loves getting in your grill and making you miserable for 94 feet, and he loves being physical. In other words, his game (specifically on the defensive end) is tailor-made to the playoffs. On the offensive end, Brooks showed unbelievable strides in his skillset during the playoffs. He’s 6 foot 7 and 225 pounds, and he’s got a surprisingly polished offensive game. Like Huerter, he has a solid handle and can get to his spots in the mid-range and just rise up, which allows him to shoot over defenders with ease. He’s a lot stronger going to the hoop than Huerter, though, and he’s got a real knack for finishing around the rim with a number of different push-type shots with both hands. Finally, he can hit the three point shot, which forces defenses to guard him on the perimeter, therefore opening up room for Brooks to attack the paint. If Brooks continues his development on the offensive end, I really think he can turn into one of the best two-way players in the NBA. He averaged 25.8 points in this postseason against a very solid Jazz defense, and there’s no question he’s already one of the toughest perimeter defenders to go up against in the league. He’s only going to continue to improve, and he’s a name that you’re going to hear in the all-star conversation next year.

2) Trae Young

If you had any gripe with Trae Young being considered a superstar before the playoffs, you can no longer have that gripe. I mean, you can, you would just be very wrong. Trae Young has a few offensive qualities that, when paired together, make him virtually impossible to stop. The first thing he has is a great shooting touch from range; you can’t leave him with a step, or else he’ll get his three off quickly and will kill you. This forces defenses to pick him up basically as soon as he walks over halfcourt (much like Curry or Lillard), and it forces them to go over screens as well. The second thing that Trae possesses is an unbelievable first step - probably the best in basketball. His change of speed and ability to burst by the defense is second to none in the NBA, and when paired with his ability to shoot, it allows him to drive with incredible ease; he had the 3rd most drives per game in the entire NBA this season, which is pretty remarkable for a scrawny guy like Trae. Trae also has the best floater game in the NBA (by far). He takes and makes the most floaters in the league, and he doesn’t really need any space or time to get it off, which makes it quite lethal. He’s also the best lob thrower in the NBA; his lob (the majority of the time to either Capela or Collins) looks exactly like his floater, too, so it makes the Hawks virtually impossible to defend once Trae gets in the painted area. When Trae throws the ball in the air, the defense is afraid to block it (because if it’s a floater, it could be called for goaltending), and that oftentimes results in an easy dunk for one of the athletic ATL front court players. When combining these three qualities (shooting touch, quick first step, and lethal floater/lob game), it makes Trae dominant offensively. It doesn’t end there, though. Trae has that killer instinct, which I think many people were surprised by; people thought that once the pressure intensified as it does during the playoffs, Trae would have a hard time dealing with it. Instead, however, Trae used the defenses’ over-aggression to his advantage, blowing by the defense and either getting fouled or getting to his floater/lob game. He talked trash to opposing players, opposing fans, and literally anyone who was willing to listen to him. Against PHI, not only did he play against one of the meanest fanbases in the league, but he was defended primarily by Ben Simmons and Matisse Thybulle, two incredibly tough and physical PLAYOFF defenders. He wasn’t phased in the slightest, and it was unbelievably fun to watch. Trae put the entire ATL team on his back throughout the entire playoffs, and he’s proven that he must be considered a top 5 NBA point guard.

I understand him not traveling to Phoenix 100%, as I’ve seen that the elevation would be bad for his knee. I think I would also understand him completely missing home games if it would make more sense to rest or rehab at home.

But, if he’s healthy enough to travel to the home games, and if he has any shot at returning this year (like has been suggested), how could he not be healthy enough to sit with the team? Does anyone have any good information on why he chooses not to?

I can only see it 2 ways:
1) His knee is in a super bad spot, and it’s easier for him to get in an out of the suites rather than the player areas and the bench. I don’t see why it would be this since he currently sits in a normal chair at the games, but it could be.

2) He doesn’t feel connected to this team at all, something that is really tough to see from the teams “leader”. Could he possibly just value his own comfort and the company that he can keep in the suite more than what he could provide to the team from the bench? Does he already have one foot out the door, similar to when he wouldn’t attend Spurs games?

Whatever the reason, I think the whole situation is super weird. Kawhi has been one of the most untraditional superstars, so it isn’t necessarily surprising, just odd.


Edit: this article someone linked in the comments kind of solves this: https://www.nba.com/news/kawhi-leonard-is-nowhere-on-court-everywhere-else-for-la

"nbadiscussion","Overall-Palpitation6","What would a fully healthy US Olympic basketball team look like?","2021-22-06 1:12:00 PM","With the recent news that [Khris Middleton and Kevin Love](https://www.espn.com/olympics/basketball/story/_/id/31686917/khris-middleton-kevin-love-commit-team-usa-two-spots-remain-roster) had committed to Team USA for the Tokyo Olympics, I was wondering what would Team USA look like if every potential player was fully healthy? 

Taking into account positional need, as well as overall team fit, this is what I came up with:

|Position|Player|
:--|:--|
|PG|Stephen Curry|
|SG|Kawhi Leonard|
|SF|Kevin Durant|
|PF|LeBron James|
|C|Anthony Davis|
|6th|James Harden|
|Bench|Damian Lillard|
|Bench|Klay Thompson|
|Bench|Karl-Anthony Towns|
|Bench|Chris Paul|
|Bench|Jimmy Butler|
|Bench|Draymond Green|

KAT is really the only true center on the team, but LeBron, AD, KD, and Draymond are all capable playing the 5. They might struggle a little against a bulky center like Jokic or Embiid, but there simply aren't many centers in the world today that are dominant post scorers. 

I also went back and forth quite a bit on the starting lineup. Although Harden is a better player IMO than Kawhi, I felt his playmaking would be greatly reduced in a lineup with Steph and LeBron, so I have him as the 6th man (a role he's familiar with). 

Lastly, the bench is certainly guard heavy, but with Kawhi, KD, and LeBron in the starting lineup, I didn't feel the need to add any other wings besides Butler. It was really a toss-up between Paul George and Butler for me, and while PG is better offensively, I simply trust Butler more on both ends of the court*.

Snubs:

Julius Randle- one more year like this past season with some minor improvements, and he's likely on the team

Russell Westbrook- Like Harden, his playmaking is greatly reduced on this team. Unlike Harden though, he offers virtually no spacing with his shooting

Devin Booker/Bradley Beal- Great scorers that would be exceptional off-ball. Dame is a better playmaker though, and while Klay isn't quite as well rounded on offense overall, he's even better off-ball and a far better defender.

:--|:--|
|PG|Stephen Curry|
|SG|Kawhi Leonard|
|SF|Kevin Durant|
|PF|LeBron James|
|C|Anthony Davis|
|6th|James Harden|
|Bench|Damian Lillard|
|Bench|Klay Thompson|
|Bench|Karl-Anthony Towns|
|Bench|Chris Paul|
|Bench|Jimmy Butler|
|Bench|Draymond Green|

KAT is really the only true center on the team, but LeBron, AD, KD, and Draymond are all capable playing the 5. They might struggle a little against a bulky center like Jokic or Embiid, but there simply aren't many centers in the world today that are dominant post scorers. 

I also went back and forth quite a bit on the starting lineup. Although Harden is a better player IMO than Kawhi, I felt his playmaking would be greatly reduced in a lineup with Steph and LeBron, so I have him as the 6th man (a role he's familiar with). 

Lastly, the bench is certainly guard heavy, but with Kawhi, KD, and LeBron in the starting lineup, I didn't feel the need to add any other wings besides Butler. It was really a toss-up between Paul George and Butler for me, and while PG is better offensively, I simply trust Butler more on both ends of the court*.

Snubs:

Julius Randle- one more year like this past season with some minor improvements, and he's likely on the team

Russell Westbrook- Like Harden, his playmaking is greatly reduced on this team. Unlike Harden though, he offers virtually no spacing with his shooting

Devin Booker/Bradley Beal- Great scorers that would be exceptional off-ball. Dame is a better playmaker though, and while Klay isn't quite as well rounded on offense overall, he's even better off-ball and a far better defender.

Ben Simmons- *insert your favorite ""shit on Ben Simmons"" post from the past 48 hours*

&#x200B;

From the 1993 to 2005 Season, Shaq averaged 67 games per Season. **For the first scenario I will do the following:**

1. In the final six Seasons of his career, I’m going to continue to use 67 games each year.
2. Instead of using his points per game as they were, I’m instead going to take a different approach, and decrease his ppg by 1.5ppg each successive Season.

**Scenario One:**

&#x200B;

**Now I’m going to assume Shaq:**

1. Ends up playing 20 Seasons instead of 19.
2. Plays 70 games per Season for his remaining seven Seasons (after 2005).
3. Decreased his ppg by 1ppg each year instead of 1.5.

So you'd still have Kobe/Shaq Lakers from 05-08ish. If we're talking about a scenario where Shaq did stay fit but still fueded with Kobe and ended up getting traded to the Heat.... I honestly don't see too much of a difference given his advanced age by that time. They had a 3-2 lead on the Pistons in 05, but Wade being injured in game 6 kind of screwed them over. Maybe if Shaq was slightly more fit, and dominated the Pistons more they could've beat them to advanced to the finals? That would've been his best chance for another ring outside of his Lakers rings IMO. He'd win one in 06, that's a given. He was injured for half of the 07 season, I guess you could argue that he wouldn't have gotten injured had he been more fit. But Wade was also missing 30 games, perhaps a healthier Shaq could carry them to 50 wins in the regular season and maybe past the 1st round in the playoffs. But Wade was clearly off that year, so they probably won't make it far with Wade not at 100% Wade was injured again in 08, the Heat probably still trades Shaq since he's 35 now. He'd probably still suck with the Suns since they play a COMPLETELY different style and he's just not a good fit at 35 years old no matter how good of a shape his body is in. Maybe he contributes more to the Cavs and Celtics in '10 and '11 but it's hard to expect a 37/38 year old to make a huge impact at that point.",14,0.101,0.736,0.163,0.967,4.63
"nbadiscussion","arachnoph","Top 4 Playoff Chokers in Recent History","2021-08-07 3:35:38 AM","For this list, I'm gonna be evaluating the 4 players who I think in the last 5 or 6 years, have had a history of playing poorly in the playoffs consistently. I've decided to leave Paul George out of this list because of this playoffs especially since he beat a Jazz team he shouldn't have beaten without Kawhi and taking the suns to 6 games. 

**Russell Westbrook :**

2018 1st Round vs Utah Jazz - Losing to this Jazz team was inexcusable for Westbrook. Westbrook UNDOUBTADLY had the better team with Paul George, Carmelo and Steven Adams. On the other side, Westbrook was facing a Utah team led by a ROOKIE Donovan Mitchell and Rudy Gobert. To me this was Westbrooks most embarrassing defeat simply because you just can't lose to a less talented team led by a rookie. Westbrook played subpar in the first 4 games which was ultimately why they were down 3-1. He had an amazing game 5 and a fairly good game 6 but it was already too late. Furthermore he was outplayed by Mitchell.

2019 1st Round vs Blazers - Now I didn't expect the Thunder to beat the Blazers but if if you lose to a better team you HAVE to show up. Westbrook played subpar in the first 2 games and a great game 3 but game 4 was the most important game. You couldn't afford to go down 3-1 and Westbrook put up 14 points on 5-21 shooting that game. The series was over at that point. He shot 11-31 in game 5 and made some bad decisions down the stretch and the rest was history (Dame).

2020 WCSF vs Lakers - Westbrook looked dominant during the regular season averaging 27 7 and 7 torching defenses up with the rockets small ball system. Now i didn't expect the Rockets to beat the Lakers but I thought and many others thought the series was going to be WAY more competitive than it turned out to be. Westbrook ended up averaging 20 7 and 5 on 42% shooting and 53% ft shooting the entire series including an anemic 10 point game in the game 5 which they desperately needed to stay alive.

**James Harden** : Harden's problem isn't his performance in the playoffs, its just about making THE plays in the crucial moments that ultimately allow you to win.

2017 Game 6 vs Spurs - We all know what happened, the infamous disappearing act. To me this is the MOST disappointing game I've seen a player play in recent history. At home, with no Kawhi Leonard playing, harden puts up 10 points on 2-11 and 6 turnovers, almost losing by FOURTY.

2018 Game 7 vs Warriors - I don't blame Harden for losing game 6 but game 7? The rockets were up by 11 at halftime looking ready to close out the warriors. They ended up losing by 9. This may be nitpicking but in my eyes Harden should've closed them out

2019 Game 5 and 6 vs Warriors - After Durant tore his achilles the game entered the 4th quarter tied at 72 a piece. This was the perfect opportunity for the rockets to steal this game. Instead Harden basically went scoreless for the last 10 min and 30 seconds of the 4th and lost. Now after this game I said that it would be okay if Harden lost to the warriors this series but it was inexcusable if he couldnt win game 6 on his turf. Once again as the game went down to the wire it was Curry not Harden that made the plays down the stretch to win the game.

2020 Game 4 vs Lakers - Heading into game 4 down 2-1 the rockets needed to win game 4 to prevent going down 3-1. Harden went 2-11 from the field scoring a majority of his points from the ft line and lost effectively ending the series. 

**Demar Derozan :**

2017 ECSF vs Cavaliers - Again, i dont expect you to beat the better team but if you're gonna lose you need to show up. After having probably his best regular season ever averaging 27 4 and 5, Derozan was absolute trash vs the cavs, g (a noticeable pattern) averaging 21 4 and 4 including a 5 point game 2 performance and got swept.

2018 ECSF vs Cavaliers - Almost like clockwork, except he was even worse this series. The raptors as the number 1 seed were no doubt the better team and more talented than the 4 seeded Cavs. So what happened? Raptors got swept by the cavs again and this time Derozan averaged 17 4 and 3 including an 8 point game 3 performance and 13 point game 4 performance.

**Kevin Love** : For Love, his playoff failures are more about how he just doesn't show up in the big moments in the finals

2016 Finals - No doubt he had an exceptional defensive moment on Steph Curry but the guy averaged 8.5 points and 7 rebounds in the finals on 36% shooting including the infamous 2 point game 5 and 9 points in game 7

2017 Finals - Upon looking on his numbers, 16 and 11 on 39% shooting, dont seem that terrible but again he didnt show up when it mattered most. In the pivotal game 3 once again he stunk it up going 1-9 with 9 points. And then in game 5 which was the desperation game, he stunk it up again with 0 points at halftime finishing with 6 points in total.

2018 1st Round vs Pacers and ECF vs Celtics - You would expect with kyrie irving gone that Love's numbers would go slightly up due to him having more opportunities. Well in the 1st Round vs Pacers, the guy averaged 11 points on 33% shooting and then in the ECF vs the Celtics he averaged 12 points on 37% shooting. He just didn't seem like the 2nd star Lebron needed","t3_og4ka6","https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/og4ka6/top_4_playoff_chokers_in_recent_history/",0,15,"t1_h4gzjsf","2021-08-07 6:33:29 AM","Kevin Love was definitely a liability against the Warriors, but imo his game 7 in 2016 was just what we needed.

Playoffs","2021-30-06 6:52:28 PM","We're all annoyed that we haven't gotten to see teams compete at full strength. But, we're dealt the hand we're dealt. It got me wondering about the best things that have come from this playoffs so far. And one thing that I've found striking is how many players have substantially raised their value/improved their reputation. The injuries opened up space for players to spread their wings, and it dropped expectations for most squads so that we can see what happens without lamenting what should have happened (there are a few glaring exceptions, and I'll note them). Here's a ~~quick~~ long-winded summary of some of the highlights:

* **Trae Young:** Went from a top 25ish player in people's rankings who might be a good stats on a bad team player to an unquestioned super star. His play was punctuated with a tough-as-nails, heel/ham persona.
* **Deandre Ayton:** Went from a solid young center that we hoped could make a few contributions in the playoffs to an efficient monster. There's still more to see how he sustains this play, but his ceiling was raised considerably.
* **Paul George:** There's a lot of straw manning about how the haters and fans felt, but let's be honest. Paul George was unquestionably an amazing talent who had not performed up to superstar expectations at a consistent enough level. He has absolutely been a superstar this postseason.
* **Chris Paul:** Dude hasn't had the playoff success that a pantheon point guard ought to have. He may or may not be the best player on his team, but the Suns are a team with his stamp on them, and they are clearly better for their resemblance to CP3.
* **Kevin Durant:** He definitely wanted the ring this year, and so it's a disappointment. But somehow I don't think it could've worked out better for him from a PR perspective. With Kyrie and Harden injured, KD got to put on some of the best basketball games we've ever seen anyone play. And afterward to go tell Giannis to get him one just felt right. Dude loves to hoop, and he has maybe settled into his skin enough to let that be his defining characteristic, rather than pursuing acceptance on social media.
* **Nicola Jokic**: I don't think his value changed in most people's minds, but he shored up his MVP claims by delivering in the first round and no one blames him for the Nuggets being outmatched without their number 2.
* **Seth Curry**: Seth is definitely the lowest rated player on this list so far, but his scoring for the Sixers when it was desperately needed by the Simmons void (more on that below) might have bumped him up a tier.
* **Reggie Jackson:** This guy was basically out of the league and now he's the best isolation player in basketball. Dude is unstoppable. It doesn't make sense to me, but I'm enjoying the show.
* **Role Players**: Without many of the #1 and #2 players, it's not just the new player that steps into that 'leader' spot, but the other 6th+ man who get to step up and shine as a starter. In this category, we have Terance Mann, Kevin Huerter, Boban!, Cam Payne, and others (let me know who I should be calling out here!).

Some folks have had good postseason but I feel like some negative storylines have kept their stock lower than it should be, but I still count them as net positives.

* **Giannis Antetokounmpo:** Yes, the Bucks almost lost to a depleted Nets squad and Giannis takes 45 seconds to miss a free throw. But the Shaq comparisons are becoming more and more apt: he puts up dominant numbers and can overwhelm opponents with his size and athleticism. Maybe he needs a ""Kobe/Wade"" closer to make some shots late, but Giannis absolutely can be the best player on a championship team.
* **Luka Doncic**: His stock was already high, and it would've soared even more if the Mavs closed out the Clippers. But, they didn't, his franchise is lurching around him, and both Trae and Ayton are still in the playoffs. That said, Luka's first round performance was so good, even while injured, that it feels like he took the next step in his career arc that has an all-time pantheon ceiling.
* **Dame Lillard**: That 55 point performance that had the entire NBA world watching and tweeting was a masterpiece. Moments like that is why I watch basketball. It's a disappointing season for the Blazers, and the current rumors of Dame \*maybe\* being unhappy further cloud things. On the whole, though, I'll remember Lillard's good more than the Blazers' bad this year.

It wouldn't be fair to argue that it's been a mostly positive-storyline (sans injuries) postseason without sharing what I think are the negative stories. I think these are pretty obvious, but I hope you'll see that there are really far fewer of these than positive ones:

* **Ben Simmons:** From All Star who should be a superstar to a 76ers PR project to improve his trade value. I think he'll be fine in time, but it's rough.
* **Rudy Gobert:** The one seed for Utah could've allowed Rudy to shake the reputation of being a great 'regular season' defender who can't get it done in the playoffs. I don't think he was as bad as some have said this postseason--he got put in impossible situations guarding the weak corner when the other subpar defenders on the Jazz got blown by. That said, it's hard to call this postseason a positive one for Rudy.
* **Dennis Schroder:** The Lakers mostly get a pass for losing to the Suns because of AD. Schroder was was so bad that he can't hide behind that injury.
* **Anthony Davis:** Of the injured players, AD gets the most flak. He's got a reputation for being injured too often, and this postseason doesn't instill confidence in Lakers fans going forward. His stock isn't tanking, but it's lower than it was six months ago.
* **All non-Lillard Blazers:** Dame is too good for the team to lose in the first round with a healthy roster.

Lastly, let's think about the narrative for the championship team, whoever it may be. I think at this point, regardless of who wins, it will be a redemption narrative:

* **Bucks**: Giannis takes the next step and solidifies himself as not just a great athlete but a top tier player who deserves the MVP accolades. Coach Bud also probably gets some redemption narrative going (though I personally still don't think he's been very good).
* **Suns**: CP3 and Booker are vindicated.
* **Clippers**: PG gets his flowers. Ty Lue gets a *ton* of praise.
* **Hawks:** Trae's getting ""he's a top 5 player"" buzz and Nate McMillan gets his due.

The highest expectations here are on the Bucks, and Giannis' injury even takes that off. So I think this is more of a championship for a team to win than it is one for a team to lose. That makes the positive stories even more compelling.

In my opinion, it could go either way. Siakam is a cornerstone of the team and has many great years ahead of him. But this trade could be a possible power move for the team. They could end up like the 87’ Bulls ( Getting Scottie Pippen and Horace Grant in the same draft ) and have a bright future as a team with two very talented players, as well as James Wiseman, who also has a lot of potential as a player. 

Personally though, I do think they should play it safe. I’m a little biased since Siakam is my favourite player on the Raptors, but he is currently one of the best players on the team.

Simmons could replace Derozan and be a young building block for the Spurs. Of course, other things might be required in this trade. Maybe the 76ers want Patty Mills, and the Spurs can get Danny Green back or something.

"nbadiscussion","dj_craw","Who says no?","2021-28-06 3:24:53 PM","Playing with the NBA trade machine is too fun right now.  So many potential moving parts.  I have a couple made up trades that I think work for everyone involved:    


Trade #1 - Shake things up.  

Essentially an asset grab for PHI.  They get Wiggins, Okogie and two lottery picks this year.  They can use all of that for whatever they want to try and get for it, CJ, Siakam, whatever.  GSW adds a stud big man and can basically be the West Coast Nets.  Wolves get Simmons and Wiseman to pair with Edwards in a core that is more on the same time arc than Towns and Edwards.

Trade #2:  Oh Canada!  

This one looks a bit more Ujiri to me.  With Lowry likely out the door, Ujiri cashes in on Siakam and gets a haul in return.  Siakam-Curry-Thompson gives everyone in the West heartburn next year.  Meanwhile, the Raptors have 3 (!!) lottery picks this year, Wiggins goes back home and Wiseman comes along to help rebuild around the lottery haul.  FVV, Wiggins, Anunoby etc keep them respectably competitive while they help mentor the young stable of studs they have from this years draft.

Trade #3:  Change of scenery...

A little shell game with some of the leagues top stars.  Dame lands in Philly with Embiid forming a scary duo.  Siakam goes to Portland to team up with CJ and a squad that needed a little length come playoff time.  Toronto gets to try the Simmons rehab project stacking him next to FVV, OG and whatever young stud they get at #4 this year.  It's a rebuild without the rebuild.  Everyone wins.

Trade 2 isn't as lopsided as the other two but still not worth it for Toronto, why get rid of Siakam now? And they would be selling low on him for no apparent goal. Wiggins is still a negative, and depending on where you place Wiseman's upside he isnt a significant asset either. The floor he showed this season wasn't very comforting, and you have to be sure your player development can get him on the right track. You forgot to include a bazillion picks that would be going to Portland in this scenario, and even then you need more rotation players or young talent to get them to even pick up the phone again after they hang up the first time.

Who’s willing to give up assets for a pending RFA that CLE seems to not want to pay AND give him the money he’ll seek in an extension or in RFA? It’s just a lot of questions that makes it a stickier situation to get a clear answer on. I’ll also add from an OKC perspective the questions I have as well: Is he a big enough upgrade offensively over Dort to make the sacrifice on the defensive downgrade? Can SGA or Dort hold up defensively at the 3? Do you even want SGA exerting that much energy on that end given how efficient he is offensively? And can Sexton play well enough defensively to let those lineups play? Why is CLE shopping him after 3 years instead of paying him? If the answer is “he’s not good enough to be a starter on a playoff team” then do you believe them or think they’re vastly underrating their own player? What is CLE asking for him?

*I will be referring to this later on in my analysis*.

**Ben Has Little Value.**

Ben Simmons' trade value plummeted during the course of the 2021 playoffs. The best trade package that the 76ers could possibly get in return for Ben Simmons right now is CJ McCollum and Robert Covington, and a lineup of that nature simply isn't going to get them anywhere near contending status. I pulled up a few of the trade offers that I found off B/R's ""Expert"" Trade packages: [https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2944844-br-nba-expert-trade-packages-for-philadelphia-76ers-star-ben-simmons](https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2944844-br-nba-expert-trade-packages-for-philadelphia-76ers-star-ben-simmons) You could read the article for a full analysis but I don't want to make my thread long.

*Simmons for CJ McCollum*

*Simmons for Buddy Hield, Marvin Bagley*

*Simmons for Kemba Walker*

*Simmons for D'Angelo Russel*

*Simmons to the Mavs, Kristaps to the Rockets, John Wall to the 76ers*

These are all hypothetical trades, but you can clearly see this guy isn't worth that much right now. None of the pieces you would acquire in any of these trades put the 76ers in championship contention.

**Joel Embiid Has A Lot Of Value And Is Very Injury Prone**

Embiid is coming off the best season of his career, where he just finished second in MVP voting and likely would've won the award if he played a full season. That is where the problem lies. A guy with Embiid's injury history, size, and weight is NEVER going to play a full season. I don't care what anyone says, this guy has been injured far too often and his injuries are NEVER going to get better. His value is only going to go down as the 76ers championship aspirations dwindle even farther.

With two years left on his deal, the 76ers could get an amazing trade package for him. I would assume that it would be a better deal than the one the Pelicans got for Anthony Davis since Embiid hasn't requested a trade so there isn't an impending need to trade him like there is for Ben Simmons.

If you don't believe me about the injury stuff, you can look at Anthony Davis and tell me how that worked out for the Lakers this year. And FYI, its going to be worse for Joel Embiid because hes 7'0 270lbs. Trading him right now would be the best thing for the franchise in the immediate future.

**The Big Three Doesn't Fit Together**

There is no point in trying to make Simmons, Embiid, and Harris work together. It just doesn't work.

You have to treat Simmons like a big and when you look at how the team is presently constructed, they are never going to win with two starting bigs. Simply put, Joel Embiid does not fit well at all with Ben Simmons and neither of them fit in a three way with Tobias Harris. They're all below average three point shooters in today's NBA.

Embiid: 37.7%

Tobias: 39.4%

Simmons: ... we don't have to do that to him

Though they did surround the team with role players that can shoot, it just seems like this team can't get anything done because its 3 stars are below average shooters.

**For Simmons To Be Successful, You Have To Build A Team Around Him**

Its been 4 years so the thought that Simmons is magically going to develop a jump shot is nonsense. He can get better at free throws and even if he is able to get to at least 70% (very doable if he works on just that), he can be an incredibly serviceable player. All he needs to work to get better for now is the free throw line and definitely develop a midrange game.

Knowing this, you have to surround the team with pieces that revolve around Simmons' skillset. Similar to how Milwaukee is building around Giannis Antetokounmpo, the 76ers have to build the team with Simmons' shooting woes in mind.

As for what these pieces might be, this is the part that I struggled with but thats why the Sixers hired Daryl Morey.

**Ben Simmons, The Player**

Here are a few Ben Simmons physical profile stats that would be great to keep in mind:

**Height**: 6'10

**Weight**: 250

**Wingspan**: 7'0

**Strengths**: Elite Passing Vision, Defensive Versatility, Defensive IQ, Interior Presence, Ability to guard 1-5, Elite ability to playmake and put the ball on the floor, basically everything that doesn't involve shooting

**Weaknesses**: Shooting

*His only weakness is shooting. That's something you can fix.*

You can't teach 6'10, 250lbs with the ability to put the ball on the floor the way that Simmons can. People don't understand, this guy is a physical freak of nature. Embiid is a freak of nature, but Simmons is legitimately a physical phenom. He does everything almost perfectly, except shoot the damn ball.

You can teach someone to be a decent shooter, but you can never teach someone to be 6'10 250lbs.

**Summary**

Embiid is really injury prone and likely will leave with amazing trade value so it is best to act on a trade this offseason which involves moving Joel Embiid. Simmons has terrible trade value so there really isn't a point to move him because the team won't get better. Build the team around Simmons with the assets you can get in return for Joel Embiid. A general manager like Daryl Morey won't have a problem figuring this out. One of the best basketball minds in the league. Also Tobias harris has an unmovable contract so your best bet is just to figure out how to work Simmons and Harris.

His body language screams that he doesn’t really care since he has secured the bag. Compare him to Giannis and you can see the difference. Giannis probably will never be a shooter but he will always be a worker.  Other than that your logic has some obvious flaws. Joel like AD might be injury prone but they hold value cause are MVP caliber players when healthy. They are phenomenal all around talents. Ben is a gamble. If he continues do underperform he will literally be untradeable consuming massive cap space.  Second, Ben won’t be a PF or C overnight. He is far from that and is undersized enough to even out his lack of skill. Giannis has freakish athleticism that allows him to change position, yet he also lacks basic post skills. Come playoff time they can’t play that position overnight, it needs time. Third, no team trades an MVP caliber player against his will that played well in playoffs. It either receives a bunch of many good players, meaning constructing a new team or swapping superstars which is practically impossible and will probably be a downgrade. Also, this team loses respect to every superstar free agent. It has never happened for a reason.  That said, if Ben stays philly fans will riot. Nothing guarantees that he will be significantly better come playoff time no matter how much he works. A change of scenery will benefit him and he is still a good fit for many teams that don’t aim to win it all",3,0.083,0.722,0.195,0.988,4.45

These are all hypothetical trades, but you can clearly see this guy isn't worth that much right now. None of the pieces you would acquire in any of these trades put the 76ers in championship contention.

**Joel Embiid Has A Lot Of Value And Is Very Injury Prone**

Embiid is coming off the best season of his career, where he just finished second in MVP voting and likely would've won the award if he played a full season. That is where the problem lies. A guy with Embiid's injury history, size, and weight is NEVER going to play a full season. I don't care what anyone says, this guy has been injured far too often and his injuries are NEVER going to get better. His value is only going to go down as the 76ers championship aspirations dwindle even farther.

With two years left on his deal, the 76ers could get an amazing trade package for him. I would assume that it would be a better deal than the one the Pelicans got for Anthony Davis since Embiid hasn't requested a trade so there isn't an impending need to trade him like there is for Ben Simmons.

If you don't believe me about the injury stuff, you can look at Anthony Davis and tell me how that worked out for the Lakers this year. And FYI, its going to be worse for Joel Embiid because hes 7'0 270lbs. Trading him right now would be the best thing for the franchise in the immediate future.

**The Big Three Doesn't Fit Together**

There is no point in trying to make Simmons, Embiid, and Harris work together. It just doesn't work.

You have to treat Simmons like a big and when you look at how the team is presently constructed, they are never going to win with two starting bigs. Simply put, Joel Embiid does not fit well at all with Ben Simmons and neither of them fit in a three way with Tobias Harris. They're all below average three point shooters in today's NBA.

Embiid: 37.7%

Tobias: 39.4%

Simmons: ... we don't have to do that to him

Though they did surround the team with role players that can shoot, it just seems like this team can't get anything done because its 3 stars are below average shooters.

**For Simmons To Be Successful, You Have To Build A Team Around Him**

Its been 4 years so the thought that Simmons is magically going to develop a jump shot is nonsense. He can get better at free throws and even if he is able to get to at least 70% (very doable if he works on just that), he can be an incredibly serviceable player. All he needs to work to get better for now is the free throw line and definitely develop a midrange game.

Knowing this, you have to surround the team with pieces that revolve around Simmons' skillset. Similar to how Milwaukee is building around Giannis Antetokounmpo, the 76ers have to build the team with Simmons' shooting woes in mind.

As for what these pieces might be, this is the part that I struggled with but thats why the Sixers hired Daryl Morey.

**Ben Simmons, The Player**

Here are a few Ben Simmons physical profile stats that would be great to keep in mind:

**Height**: 6'10

**Weight**: 250

**Wingspan**: 7'0

**Strengths**: Elite Passing Vision, Defensive Versatility, Defensive IQ, Interior Presence, Ability to guard 1-5, Elite ability to playmake and put the ball on the floor, basically everything that doesn't involve shooting

**Weaknesses**: Shooting

*His only weakness is shooting. That's something you can fix.*

You can't teach 6'10, 250lbs with the ability to put the ball on the floor the way that Simmons can. People don't understand, this guy is a physical freak of nature. Embiid is a freak of nature, but Simmons is legitimately a physical phenom. He does everything almost perfectly, except shoot the damn ball.

You can teach someone to be a decent shooter, but you can never teach someone to be 6'10 250lbs.

**Summary**

Embiid is really injury prone and likely will leave with amazing trade value so it is best to act on a trade this offseason which involves moving Joel Embiid. Simmons has terrible trade value so there really isn't a point to move him because the team won't get better. Build the team around Simmons with the assets you can get in return for Joel Embiid. A general manager like Daryl Morey won't have a problem figuring this out. One of the best basketball minds in the league. Also Tobias harris has an unmovable contract so your best bet is just to figure out how to work Simmons and Harris.

Simmons + Lillard is a good example due to the situation right now. Lillard would run and be the offense and Simmons + shooting would eat up the short roll. Simmons would guard the best player on the other team, run the game in transition and facilitate. If you have a generational scoring talent good enough to take the reins of an offense who you can get for Embiid then you trade him. There is one other archetype I think Simmons could fit into if you trade Embiid. You put him at the 4 next to a stretch 5. I think Simmons would fit remarkably next to the talents and woes of Jokic and KAT ironically enough. I think you have a point with where you’re going based on pure theoretical return but the pitfalls in your argument are the actual trades. Who do you trade Embiid for? Lillard is interesting but I can’t imagine you can take him from Portland. Paul George is intriguing as he just solidified himself as a playoff force again, but Kawhi is injured. I can’t imagine they would want to pair him with an injury prone 7 footer. Brooklyn just secured 3 of the leagues best shot creators and I don’t believe they’re gonna wanna part ways with them. Steph is in an bad situation but I wouldn’t think the warriors want to keep wiseman in that deal and the 76rs probably don’t want him. Devin Booker doesn’t seem to have any reason to want to get out of Phoenix. After that you start to drop down to more of the Brad Beal and LaVine level of player and I can’t imagine you want that kind of value for Joel Embiid.  I like the idea but I don’t think the market is in the correct state of flux for Embiid to be traded for someone and have it be worth it for the 76rs.",1,0.063,0.814,0.122,0.935,2.7199999999999998

You want someone who's not a big as the superstar coming back in the deal. Options (in principle) as I see them, point is that they're implausible and/or bad: TL;DR some half interesting stuff and a bunch of memes at the end.

Embiid for Bam Adebayo, Tyler Herro, and maybe more (maybe if the Tyler Herro situation deteriorates and they really want him out, but they would have better options than giving up Bam, even if it meant getting Embiid) Embiid for AD (if AD weren't handpicked by LeBron maybe possible but doesn't solve the injuries problem, and AD while a big can shoot, and AD was handpicked by LeBron so not happening) Embiid for Brandon Ingram, Josh Hart, and Lonzo Ball (Not solving the injuries problem, salaries are an issue) Embiid for Paul George and a bit more (could change a lot depending on how PG13 plays in the rest of the playoffs, also only will happen if Kawhi wants it since PG13 is there at his pleasure) Embiid for Gobert + picks (bad deal for the Sixers, doesn't solve the problems you were talking about, but at least the Jazz would take it if offered, tells you how crazy the rest of these ""options"" are gonna be) Embiid for Khris Middleton and Jrue Holiday (never going to happen, salaries are way off already and the Bucks would never do this it's just insane) Embiid and Harris for Middleton, Holiday, and Lopez (likewise insane) Embiid+a lot of salary filler they don't have for Brogdon, LeVert, and Turner (doesn't make the team better anyway) Embiid for Tatum and Brown (never going to happen because Celtics would be losing too much control and as we saw with Kemba are being conscientious of injury-proneness, and salary issues) Embiid for (sign-and-trade) DeRozan, assorted Spurs guards and maybe Keldon Johnson as a backup (no way, DeRozan isn't a 3-point shooter so it doesn't solve the problem, also might not agree to the sign-and-trade) Embiid for Julius Randle, straight up (lol jk I'm a Knicks fan and I love Julius Randle, bonus offer Embiid for Theo Pinson) Embiid for Jokic (no, I'm a Jokic hater anyway because the way I see it, he can never win a playoff series against a good offensive big because he's so terrible at defense, even if he is trying now. Against AD he would pick up 3 fouls early, sit a lot because of it until the fourth, then pick up 2 more fouls and either just not play defense or foul out. Embiid for KD, Harden, or Kyrie (no way the Nets do this) Embiid for CP3 (no way the Suns do this, also CP3 could just opt out if you do this before the season so may as well wait to see if Simmons improves his shot enough to make a difference next season) Embiid for Trae Young and more (no way the Hawks do this Embiid for all of the Mavs except Luka (then the Sixers would have Simmons and Porzingis as a ""guard"" who can't play guard and a ""forward"" who can't play forward, so it'd be funny oh yeah and btw we're not even pretending to care about salaries anymore) Embiid for whoever is on the Magic now (lol) Embiid for Christian Wood and Kevin Porter Jr (r/nba might go for it lol) Embiid for Siakam and more (doesn't make the Sixers better) Embiid for Vucevic and Lavine (probably doesn't make the Sixers better) Embiid for who on the Grizzlies? anyone? Embiid for De'Aaron Fox/Buddy Hield (let's not be mean to Joel and send him to Sacramento without one of those players, and doesn't make the Sixers better) Embiid for no one on the Warriors because their image of paying and keeping their championship core is important to them beyond short-term results, and the Sixers will not be helped by Wiggins and/or Oubre Embiid for Kevin Love and Cedi Osman (no) Embiid for Kemba (injury concerns are the reason to trade Embiid, OKC would have to throw in SGA but they're not going to do that, and Presti does not get to feed his pick fetish) Embiid to the an expansion team in Seattle (sorry Seattle fans, I'll stop getting your hopes up) Embiid to the Hornets for the entire team that won't improve the Sixers' situation",1,0.081,0.799,0.12,0.9909,2.7

In my opinion for the number one overall pick to be considered, a success they must make at least multiple all-star appearances. And on the verge of making the hall of fame as a 1st ballot.  But this can be seen as a bit too much since players can be successful in the league without doing so. But I believe this is a good indicator of whether the player lived up to their potential. Now Looking back at the last 10 years of number 1 picks, I determined if they meet my criteria.

The US ended up winning 107-100 but this was a close game the whole way through. Tied going into halftime, tied going into the 4th. US had to have some clutch shots from Kobe to put the game away. Funny thing is - I'm old enough to remember this game and it wasn't even a surprise that the game was close. Spain was considered a force and while it would have been an upset - they had the ability to beat the US.

My question is why doesn't a NBA team - specifically a team that is already planning on tanking (OKC, maybe Orlando, etc) - commit to building an all European team? If this Spanish team could take a team of Kobe, Dwade, LeBron, KD, CP3, Harden, etc to the brink of elimination, clearly they could have succeeded in the NBA. I'll dive into this a little bit here but I would love to hear you alls comments as well.

To start, I want to discuss if it would be possible to build such a team - take the 2012 Spanish team for example. Marc and Pau Gasol would be the most expensive pieces from an asset acquisition standpoint quickly followed by Serge Ibaka. But after these three, the team is mostly convincing overseas players to come play in the NBA. This negotiation action costs nothing to a NBA team from an asset perspective because you're just signing them as FAs. In the off chance a team happens to own a players rights, a second rounder (possibly even protected) usually takes care of that.

Further - Juan Carlos Navarro (the teams third highest scorer) hadn't played in the NBA since '08, Rudy Fernandez was on the tail end of his NBA career, and Jose Calderon was a 10 ppg rotational player that could probably be acquired for a 2nd round pick. While the Gasols and Ibaka may have been slightly pricey, neither Gasol was near the top of their value from a trade perspective and I wouldn't consider any of these three even close to an ""untouchable"" such as a current day Luka, KD, Harden, etc. You could even time it where you're signing one or a couple of these guys as FAs and not giving up any assets.

I think building this team would have been possible for a 2012-2013 NBA team. If I told you I could give you a team that could give that star studded US team a run for their money - wouldn't you unload the warchest for that team? Also - big positive here - you can trade all your current assets so you may come out without having to unload too many future picks (aka teams about to enter a tank).

Next I want to discuss why(pros)/why not(cons) this team may work.

Pros: We all know European basketball is played and developed differently than the basketball in the US. There seems to be a higher interest in fundamentals and team play as opposed to IG highlights and AAU hero ball here in the US. Maybe this team could bring a ball movement and team approach that the NBA teams would have trouble stopping, ala the '14 Spurs. Maybe Euro players in the past have been thrown into the NBA's ""AAU environment"" and that environment contributed more to their downfall than their actual skillset. Maybe the overall talent level in Europe is higher than we expect and these players can hold their own with the best of the best when given a real opportunity. Even if the experiment doesn't work, you may not have given up many assets considering most players will just be signed via FA. You can just continue the tank and build through the draft.

Cons: It seems like you would have to go all in. To really give this experiment a shot - I don't think you can take that Spanish team and add a player like Rudy Gay and expect the skill sets to match. You'd probably have to bring in an international coaching staff too. Maybe it's a simple answer why this hasn't happened yet. There's a reason the majority of these guys aren't on NBA rosters and the average athleticism of the NBA is too overpowering and the team flops.

I was thinking about this further when considering this years Olympics. While I think the US will win - I think Spain could give them a challenge. This years Spanish team could be easily assembled as well, probably without even having to give any kind of first round pick. The US is only -360 to win the entire tourney with some of the top stars the NBA has to offer, which just seems low for a team with Lillard, Booker, Beal, KD, Bam, Tatum, etc. If this was an actual NBA team I feel like they'd be -1000 at least to win the whole Finals.

I'd love to hear you alls thoughts on this. Would you give this experiment a chance? Could that 2012 Spanish team won a NBA title?

Team A:

Curry, Kobe, TMac, Lebron, Hakeem


Team B:

CP3, Jordan, KD, Giannis, Kareem


I’m leaning towards team A because I think the players are a better fit together. They have more spacing and everyone can play offball with Lebron being the main handler (assuming everyone buys in). However they are defensively weaker, having Curry and TMac compared to KD being the worst defender.

Crowder looked like he was being left on an island last game. On the other hand the Suns have probably defended the rest of the Bucks a little better. So Giannis goes for 40 but if the rest of the team struggles it’s not enough.

This is a strategy I like against a team like Dwight Magic who was surrounded by lights out guys but I’m not sure the Bucks are the best to use it against. Their personnel isn’t totally lights out in terms of shooting and one of the issues is they play at such a high defense and rebounding intensity that they are gassed on offense hence why a player like Holiday has been hot/cold on offense since he is everywhere on defense. I would take my chances with bigs like Tucker, Lopez and Portis open from 3 in the long run if it means defending Giannis better, they may hit some but I don’t know if they can win the series that way.

People use Big O and Magic to devalue him ignoring that in thirteen seasons those guys played in their careers without him not once did they win a chip. I never hear anyone bring up 89-90 when all the elements of Showtime were intact and many in their prime except Kareem (who already was diminished from even a few years prior) had retired and they’d drafted Divac who had a solid rookie campaign. But that small change at one position took Lakers from the Finals three years in a row to losing in five in the Conference Semis. All the evidence is that Kareem was more and not less important to Showtime than most think yet many still try to argue he’s less important than many think. I think it’s the same way with Shaq. People have this habit of talking about favoring “greatest peak” over greatest career yet no one ever talks about Shaq having arguably greatest individual season to result in a championship in 99-00 when talking about “greatest peak”.

"nbadiscussion","WolvesBite","Why on God’s Green Earth Did The Sixers Decline Brogdon and a FRP for Ben Simmons?","2021-03-07 1:49:41 PM","As most of us know, about 1-2 days ago, the Sixers were offered Malcolm Brogdon and a first round pick for Ben Simmons, and they declined.

But why is nobody talking about it on this sub?

First, let me say really quick that this would be a terrible trade for the Pacers. For their sake, I’m glad the Sixers declined. Simmons would be a terrible fit alongside either or both of Sabonis and Turner and would set a franchise that already struggles to get big name free agents multiple years back with his massive overpay of a contract.

But anyways, let’s talk about the Sixers side of things. 

Why the hell would they decline this trade? Brogdon is a WAY better three point shooter, WAY better free throw shooter, is on a much more reasonable and affordable contract (they would actually save about 11 million dollars making this trade), and is good enough at perimeter defense to where you could make this move and not have to make other moves to bolster your perimeter defense. They would also be eliminating competition, by giving the Pacers, a team in their own conference, someone who does not fit on their team. I hope that the Sixers don’t think they will get someone better than Brogdon for Simmons, because unless they use draft picks, they will not get an offer better than this Pacers deal. Gone are the days of Simmons being the centerpiece in a potential James Harden deal. This actually brings me to my next point.

The Sixers only have four tradeable first round picks. They have their 2021 first round pick, their 2023 first round pick, their 2022 first round pick (which would have to be a pick swap because of the Stepien rule), and their 2028 first round pick (which we don’t know how valuable that pick will be because it’s so damn far in the future). Considering Ben Simmons current trade value and how hard it is to build around him, the most that could get them is maybe a C.J. McCollum if he becomes available. On top of that, Milton, Maxey, and Thybulle are their only real young assets, and they aren’t enough to significantly alter what the Sixers would get for Ben Simmons. They would be much better off trading for the younger Malcolm Brogdon, keeping their draft picks, acquiring an additional draft pick, and saving their young assets for another trade.","t3_od637z","https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/od637z/why_on_gods_green_earth_did_the_sixers_decline/",0,44,"t1_h3ze5wk","2021-03-07 7:22:19 PM","Brogdon doesn’t make the team better is the problem also they don’t need to rush into anything they can keep listening for as long as they want and come back to it if they didn’t get a better offer",3,0.062,0.776,0.162,0.5267,3.12

Looking at results from the current publicized ballot era (2014-2021)","2021-22-06 7:25:28 AM","When the end-of-season teams are released by the NBA, discussion quickly turns to ""who was snubbed?"" [This year's All-Defense announcement](https://np.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/nzziub/charania_202021_nba_alldefensive_teams_first_team/) was no different. [A post went up on r/nba](https://np.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/nzzuxm/i_kinda_feel_bad_for_clint_capella_and_myles/) a mere 17 minutes later lamenting the cases of Clint Capela & Myles Turner, who finished 6th & 9th in DPOY voting, but missed out on All-Defense selections. In the latter post, HokageEzio commented **""Yeah, All Defense is tough because it's only two teams instead of 3. Somebody has to get cut.""** Of course, that's the inspiration for this post (and I apologize if other users have expressed the same sentiment earlier but I hadn't seen it!).

The NBA has published voting ballots after all awards have been announced since the 2014 season. I'd previously posted about the [most contrary voters in the history of public ballots](https://np.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/j7dv7k/oc_whos_the_most_contrarian_voter_in_the_history/), so I already had a database to work with. There isn't much variation in how the NBA presents its voting PDFs so extracting the 2021 results & appending them to the previous years wasn't too difficult.

Next, I had to prepare the data into a friendlier format:

* cleaning player names
   * some years have the team suffixed within parentheses while other years are suffixed after two dashes: (HOU) vs -- HOU in essence
* pivoting the data
   * the data is originally set up so that each row is a writer's full ballot for one award
   * seems unnecessary to count by each column & then sum, so I thought it best to transform the data so each row is a writer selection
* adding points given (2 for first team, 1 for second team) and positions

With the data ready, it was time to dive in! I summed each player's total by year & position to get a positional points variable. Secondly, I summed the positional points variable by year & player to get a player's total points, and took the position of the max positional points.

For example, Anthony Davis got 34 centre points & 24 forward points in 2017. So he has a total of 58 vote points and would be listed at centre. This is the same system that the NBA has used, although it has been derided in the All-NBA context: Jayson Tatum this year & Khris Middleton last year have both missed out on 3rd team All-NBA even though their total points were higher than the 3rd team guards. Tatum & Middleton had their votes split between forward & guard.

After this, it was just a simple case of taking the centre with the 3rd-highest vote tally, and the forwards/guards with the 5th & 6th highest vote tallies. Here's the results!

[This year's All-Defense announcement](https://np.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/nzziub/charania_202021_nba_alldefensive_teams_first_team/) was no different. [A post went up on r/nba](https://np.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/nzzuxm/i_kinda_feel_bad_for_clint_capella_and_myles/) a mere 17 minutes later lamenting the cases of Clint Capela & Myles Turner, who finished 6th & 9th in DPOY voting, but missed out on All-Defense selections. In the latter post, HokageEzio commented **""Yeah, All Defense is tough because it's only two teams instead of 3. Somebody has to get cut.""** Of course, that's the inspiration for this post (and I apologize if other users have expressed the same sentiment earlier but I hadn't seen it!).

The NBA has published voting ballots after all awards have been announced since the 2014 season. I'd previously posted about the [most contrary voters in the history of public ballots](https://np.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/j7dv7k/oc_whos_the_most_contrarian_voter_in_the_history/), so I already had a database to work with. There isn't much variation in how the NBA presents its voting PDFs so extracting the 2021 results & appending them to the previous years wasn't too difficult.

Next, I had to prepare the data into a friendlier format:

* cleaning player names
   * some years have the team suffixed within parentheses while other years are suffixed after two dashes: (HOU) vs -- HOU in essence
* pivoting the data
   * the data is originally set up so that each row is a writer's full ballot for one award
   * seems unnecessary to count by each column & then sum, so I thought it best to transform the data so each row is a writer selection
* adding points given (2 for first team, 1 for second team) and positions

With the data ready, it was time to dive in! I summed each player's total by year & position to get a positional points variable. Secondly, I summed the positional points variable by year & player to get a player's total points, and took the position of the max positional points.

For example, Anthony Davis got 34 centre points & 24 forward points in 2017. So he has a total of 58 vote points and would be listed at centre. This is the same system that the NBA has used, although it has been derided in the All-NBA context: Jayson Tatum this year & Khris Middleton last year have both missed out on 3rd team All-NBA even though their total points were higher than the 3rd team guards. Tatum & Middleton had their votes split between forward & guard.

After this, it was just a simple case of taking the centre with the 3rd-highest vote tally, and the forwards/guards with the 5th & 6th highest vote tallies. Here's the results!

"nbadiscussion","Phred_Phrederic","Previous Possible Steph Curry’s","2021-12-07 9:10:03 PM","Steph is an incredible offensive player but it wasn’t until Steve Kerr gave him the green light for his Warriors to become an amazingly efficient offensive machine. Steph has great shot creation and an ideal supporting cast (Klay obviously was huge) but he probably wouldn’t have reached his ceiling unless he was used in this particular way. 

That being said I came up with a few players from NBA history who could’ve possibly been the engine of a team similar to Curry Warriors. Curious for your thoughts and other possibilities. Basically looked for players with strong shooting splits who could’ve had the arcs of their careers changed by a few more 3PA. 

Ray Allen 
My favorite candidate. Has very good shooting splits with strong seasons for individual and team success (Seattle early 2000’s) aligning with 7-8 3PA’s. Also think the potential for a Rashard Lewis/Ray combo could have been a great fit for today’s offensive philosophies. I think Ray’s physical abilities could have been harnessed to support the shooting. Would love to see what his career would have been had an offense had been built around him at the beginning of his career rather than the not as efficient Glenn Robinson. Obviously Ray had a great career but think he could’ve possibly ushered in this era a tad earlier w the right coach. 

Steve Nash
Amazing shooting splits. Similar court vision and  skills. I think even Nash himself has mentioned that he would have been developed differently today. He shot solidly in the 40% from deep throughout his career but never took more than five attempts. A real tragedy. 

Mark Price
Maybe not quite on the level as the other two but Price was awesome. Unfortunately both him and his squad had some devastating injuries. I think Price is an interesting candidate because he put up 40% and had an incredible AST/TO ratio. From a stats perspective these two metrics hold the most weight in predicting winning basketball games. Would be interested to see how this translated over a larger user rate. It’s also worth noting that Price played on some Cavs teams with notoriously slow pace of play. 

These were my favorite candidates. Dale Ellis and Reggie Miller put up some strong seasons that warrant mentioning.","t3_oj7wqg","https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/oj7wqg/previous_possible_steph_currys/",1,2,"t1_h503swb","2021-12-07 9:23:59 PM","I think people massively overrate Steph's onball abilities and massively underrate his offball abilities. Obviously Curry's handle is insane, but I think he has benefited from having other balhandlers establishing offensive sets for him. He's odd, because he is a shooting guard with point guard skills, and he can play whatever role is needed (generally PG because of his defensive limitations). But I really think that a guy like Reggie is the potential Steph before Steph. Absolutely unreal efficiency, mad offball skills setting up his teammates (now way Rik Smits gets an all-star without Miller), and a complete devotion to selfless teamwork.",1,0.116,0.729,0.156,0.3963,4.0600000000000005

As nba free agency approaches and there are a few examples of players that seem to have good upside, but aren't getting the minutes because that position is stacked for that team, but that are exciting to developing teams. 

Example: The Hawks have Clint Capela and Onyeka Okongwu, and so the management is indicating that they aren't willing to pay out for John Collins, mainly because they know they have to pay a few other players next year. So Collins is probably going to walk. 

What are good examples of undervalued or underutilized players, and then they were traded, or left in free agency, to become all-stars? 

James Harden is the primary example that comes to mind.","t3_ogdeoq","https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/ogdeoq/what_players_went_from_the_bench_to_allstar_with/",13,20,"t1_h4i6c16","2021-08-07 11:52:10 AM","Isaiah Thomas is another one, went from bench scorer on the Suns to a top 10 mvp candidate on Boston the next year.

Secondly my analysis comes from everything James wanted in Houston vs what he could have had.

1. Chris Paul. CP3 and Harden were a great tandem till their personal relationship broke down. James wanted him out and Morey pulled the trigger and sent him to OKC. Now CP3 is leading the young suns into the WCF.

2. Clint Capela. This guy was an elite rebounder for James and he opened up his offense. If James missed a shot Clint was there to keep the offense going. Clint had to be moved since him and Russ clogged the court for James. Now Clint is helping the Hawks in the ECF with another free shooter in Ice Trae.

3. PJ Tucker. James always didn’t like how he didn’t have superstar talent next to him but PJ is a horse. One of the hardest working players in the league and a 3 point shooter. Now he’s in the ECF with the Bucks.

4. Mike D’Antoni. James loved MDA since he turned him from a good scorer to an elite one. MDA coddled him and the team into believing they could sacrifice easy 2 for 3 point shots. Harden followed him to Brooklyn and now they are watching from home. 

5. Daryl Morey. Another guy who coddled James. DM was never afraid to make a risky move that helped James win a title. When he left James wanted out. Now DM is stuck with Ben Simmons trying to prove he can win with Morey ball.

6. Brooklyn Nets. James finally gets his super team but he joins an often injured KD and Kyrie. It ends up not working this season due to his and Kyries injury.

7. Rafael Stone. James didn’t want to give Stone a chance in building a team around him. Stone could have offloaded Russ to the Knicks for expiring contracts to start the rebuild but he went for John Wall to give Harden a chance to consider staying here. Stone got ridiculed for not trading James for Ben Simmons but now it looks like it worked out for the Rockets as they aren’t stuck with Ben and we have the #2 pick.

8. Stephen Silas. This is a coach who James wouldn’t give a chance to. Didn’t show up to training camp. Turns out the players love him and even ex players like Luka Doncic are a starting to realize how important he was.

9. Christian Wood. A player that James really needed. A pick and pop big that he could have used in the playoffs that he didn’t want to give a chance to.

I’m not saying if James stayed we win a title this year. I’m just saying all the reasons he wanted out are starting to hurt his legacy.","t3_o70n95","https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/o70n95/the_playoffs_this_year_is_a_testament_to_james/",3,1,"t1_h3i922y","2021-29-06 5:51:28 PM","What a run though!

"nbadiscussion","RodneyPonk","Kobe Bryant Top 10 Playoff Games","2021-07-07 6:12:51 AM","Kobe is a top 10 player of all time undisputed, for me personally I have him as the 7th greatest player of all time although I consider him and Shaq to be interchangeable in the 6th and 7th spot. Here are what I consider the top 10 playoff games in his career. I'm taking into account the production (statistics and performance), the importance (elimination game, closeout game) the stage ( Finals, WCF, WCSF) and the context. Although Kobe doesn't have as many iconic epic playoff performances like Jordan, Lebron, Magic etc, he still came through when it mattered most.

10. 2009 WCSF Game 4 vs Utah Jazz. 38 points, 1 assist, 6 rebounds, 16/24 FG. Coming off one of his worst playoff games shooting an anemic 5/24 in game 3, Kobe responded in Game 4 with a barrage of tough midrange jumpers claiming a commanding 3-1 lead.

9. 2009 Finals, Game 1 vs Orlando Magic. 40 points, 8 assists, 8 rebounds. 16/34 FG. Coming into this finals, people still doubted whether Kobe could lead his team to a championship without Shaq. So Kobe put up his one and only 40 point final game.

8. 2008 WCSF, Game 5 vs San Antonio Spurs. 39 points, 3 assists, 3 rebounds, 16/30 FG. One of his most underrated series, Kobe had to face a prime defending champion San Antonio Spurs. He closed the Spurs out in game 5 with this performance which included 17 in the 4th.

7. 2001 WCSF, Game 4 vs Sacramento Kings. 48 points, 3 assists, 16 rebounds, 15/29 FG, 17/19 FT. 22 year old Kobe put the Kings away with an epic performance including 15 points in the 4th when they came into the 4th down 4.

6. 2002 Finals, Game 3 vs New Jersey. 36 points, 4 assists, 6 rebounds, 14/23 FG. Lakers came into game 3 up 2-0, winning game 3 meant winning the series. Kobe had his best game of the finals and hit a clutch dagger jump shot to put the Lakers up 4 with 20 seconds remaining sealing the finals victory.

5. 2008 WCFR, Game 2 vs Denver Nuggets. 49 points, 10 assists, 4 rebounds, 18/27 FG. In terms of pure production this is no doubt Kobe's most dominant playoff game.

4. 2010 WCF, Game 6 vs Phoenix Suns. 37 points, 2 assists, 6 rebounds, 12/25 FG. Game 6 closeout game for the Lakers. Kobe scored 11 in the 4th including 2 incredibly tough fadeaway jumpers in the face of Grant Hill in the final minute with the iconic slap on coach Alvin Gentry's butt, securing their spot in the finals.

3. 2006 WCFR, Game 6 vs Phoenix Suns. 50 points, 5 assists, 8 rebounds, 20/35 FG. Easily would be his greatest playoff performance had they won but unfortunately they lost through no fault of Kobe's. He put up a Herculean performance but the undertalented Lakers lost.

2. 2004 WCSF, Game 4 vs San Antonio Spurs. 42 points, 5 assists, 6 rebounds, 15/27 FG. Heading into Game 3, the Lakers were down 2-0 vs the spurs. After winning Game 3, the Lakers NEEDED to win Game 4 as going down 3-1 most likely would spell doom for the Lakers. Kobe put up 42 points, the momentum shifted the entire series and the Lakers would win the next 2 and beat the Spurs.

&#x200B;

1. 2000 Finals, Game 4 vs Indiana Pacers. 28 points, 5 assists, 4 rebounds, 14/27 FG. I bet most people are wondering why this fairly mediocre performance is what I consider his greatest playoff performance. This is because of the context behind this game. Lakers came into this game up 2-1 in a pivotal Game 4, meaning if the Lakers won this game, they most likely would win the series. The game went into overtime in which Shaq had fouled out whilst the game was still tight. Kobe proceeded to score 8 points in the final 2 minutes including a putback dagger with 5 seconds remaining that iced the game, sealing the win. Considering the importance of this game and the stage along with the fact that he was only 20 years old, I believe this to be his best playoff game.","t3_ofimpa","https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/ofimpa/kobe_bryant_top_10_playoff_games/",15,11,"t1_h4dqs04","2021-07-07 11:21:21 AM","LeBron Kareem Jordan Russell Duncan Bird Magic Wilt are all above Kobe, and I would argue that Shaq and Hakeem were as well.

"nbadiscussion","ShampooMonK","8 observations from this post-season.","2021-24-06 11:23:22 AM","1. Big Ball vs Small Ball centers
   1. One of things that was interesting was how in 2020, it was a season of small ball centers taking center stage. Bam Adebayo helped sink the Celtics. Anthony Davis was a defensive force. The Rockets bet the farm on PJ Tucker. All these dudes, outside Davis, were legit small for the center, while Davis is skinny. All of them had some level of success.
   2. In 2021 though, arguably what we're seeing is the rise of Big ball centers -- guys with some offensive skills but whose role is really to play D and PLAY BIG. Three of the four teams left count on guys who are Big Ball centers -- Ayton, whose a mobile 7 footer and the talk of the playoffs, Lopez, a sweet shooting big man who can box out and defend well, and Clint Capela, whose as close to a poor man's clone of Dwight Howard as any in the league. This is a big difference than from last year. I'm defining the big ball center by what they do on D not O, btw. 
2. Superstar/Hybrid Centers have done well this playoffs, but if you ask them to do too much on offense, you didn't get out of the second round
   1. The common thread of KD, Embiid and Jokic. KD saw his teammates go down and him step up to play big and score, setting up the offense. He did amazing. It wasn't enough, eliminated. Embiid had to also be the last line of defense, play big and set up his offense. It was too much, eliminated. Jokic saw his teammates go down, play big and set up his offense. MVP of the regular season, but that's too much, eliminated. If you compare this to Giannis, whose job was to play D reasonably well while also leading the offense, but not be the entirety of the defense at the rim and doing defensive rebounding, you see why he's still standing. It's going to be a while before we see a Shaq in 2000 performance ever again, something that should make us appreciate that ALOT more. 
3. Rudy Gobert took the heat for Utah losing, but the reality is is that injuries caught up to the team's guards. 
   1. We all just like to make fun of him and it's okay, he should gain a thicker skin. This one's been done ad nauseam. Just remember -- to lose a 26 point lead, both your defense and offense must fail, and considering Reggie Jackson and Terrance Mann suddenly went super saiyan, from all over the court, while Don Mitchell just couldn't score anymore, I put that lost squarely on the guards of the team, and then on Rudy. Wouldn't be shocked if their injuries are worse than we think.
4. The Suns are a young team but play like an old team, they don't turn the ball over that much and that will likely be a big reason they beat the Clippers, if they beat the Clippers.
   1. When I predicted the Lakers to go over the Suns in the first round, I was relying on old logic -- young teams don't win, even in wacky seasons. Well, that's because young teams have a tendency to self combust, turning the ball over under pressure, not knowing who should shoot on the last play, having some chemistry issues, etc. That and the Lakers thrived off teams turning the ball over last season, turning Russell Westbrook's dribbling into a liability, something that led to transition and then AD putting the other team in foul trouble. Well... I was wrong! The Suns have legit none of those issues of young teams and are pretty careful with the basketball! One wonders if this due to CP3 being a basketball wizard and changing his approach with age and playing on that OKC team last season. I genuinely believe this is the net effect of CP3, he's one of those beyond the box score leader types. 
5. Injuries had a big effect, but so do role players stepping up.
   1. People will write about this 1000x here so I'm not going to add anything. Have at it.
6. Ben Simmons scraped by on potential and now that's simply not good enough.
   1. 10 years ago, Ben Simmons would've played like Rajon Rondo, and would have been expected to have similar levels of success to Rondo. This legit wasn't that long ago, Rondo was phenomenal for a while and the league isn't fully in ""everyone must shoot"" mode until the Warriors first chip, though teams were experimenting. We still have players that are relics of that era, though increasingly, they're less effective. 
   2. As his season is now over, it's time to assess Ben Simmons and the role of ""non shooting, defense first point guards."" One surmises that a point guard who can't shoot, can't effectively do his job despite being 6'10, because the defense sags back in the playoffs. This isn't so much an issue if you're going to be running at the basket all the time in transition. The thing with playoff ball is that, transition opportunities get limited by teams suddenly playing much more carefully with the ball.
   3. This then begs the question, are we simply miscasting Ben Simmons as a point guard now? Is he ACTUALLY a point guard or is he... a point forward or small ball 5? I think this is the major question surrounding Simmons, which is A) what is he and B) how much should he be enabled by teams (the Westbrook question). It doesn't take a genius to see he's probably needing a rethinking of what he can do by someone. 
7. Trae Young, Kawhi Leonard, Luka Doncic, Kevin Durant, Donovan Mitchell, Devin Booker are keeping Kobe's memory alive even better than the 2020 Lakers did, by shooting from the midrange so effectively. 
   1. Arguably, this should be the least shocking thing about the playoffs -- when the clock ticks down and the balls in the superstars hands, their job is to make silly, ridiculous shots, like Kobe did, like Wade did, like Jordan did, etc. The midrange is the superstars shot, it's the shot they get paid for, and I just listed 6 guys who having that midrange in the game is probably lifting them past their peers. 
8. The Hawks vs Bucks is a major question of winning in the NBA -- is defense or offense more important? 
   1. The Hawks are a better offensive team that is an okay defensive team. Capela helps. But you know, their best defense is shooting and making shots, kinda like the old Rockets were.
   2. The Bucks are a staunch SLOW IT DOWN AND TRY TO SCORE ON US defensive team, with some shooters to keep the game close if the other team is scoring a lot or make the game get out of hand if the opponent can't score at all. They have four good defenders in the starting lineup, and in a way, somewhat resemble the 2020 Lakers, only Middleton is in the AD free safety role.
   3. I don't know who would win, my prediction even after game 1 is this is a knockdown dragout series, but there's legit two philosophies on the floor, and if the Bucks win it would match my perception that BAD ASS D wins titles. But they also could not win. I don't know. 
9. The teams left standing all have a combination of young guys and veterans, affirming what I, a know nothing fan, have always believed in was the championship formula.
   1. Whether its the Hawks with Gallinari, Bucks with Jrue, Clippers with Reggie Jackson, or the Suns with CP3, the impact of guys with 10 plus year careers in the league can often be felt in that even if they're bad, they provide some steadiness in the playoffs. Arguably these guys have bigger roles than they had, getting their big contracts, outside Reggie Jackson. Always important to note is whose got a team built like this, IMO.","t3_o76t0q","https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/o76t0q/8_observations_from_this_postseason/",9,4,"t1_h2x1lha","2021-24-06 12:07:52 PM",">Big Ball vs Small Ball centers   >   >One of things that was interesting was how in 2020, it was a season of small ball centers taking center stage.  The Rockets bet the farm on PJ Tucker. Rockets didn't bet the farm on **PJ Tucker,** they had no choice. Rockets made the mistake of trading for Westbrook. Now, they were forced to be committed to the micro-ball route and traded for RoCo and trotted out a small ball lineup that featured PJ Tucker, (who ALSO was DISGRUNTLED already for not being given a contract extension and for playing through a pinched nerve at center while standing a buck 6'5,) at the 5. I never understood why they were convinced that the micro ball of relying on a lot of shooters that didn't well shoot at all was going to work... RoCo had a terrible shooting year at 31.5%, Eric Gordon shot 31.7%. You really need some positive production rather than mass inefficient volume 3 point shooting. Honestly, I think the Rockets made a mistake trading away Capela. I never understood why they were so quick to get rid of him, getting rid of your best rebounder, shot blocker, and under 26 locked up for next 3 years. But Westbrook/Harden killed their spacing and rendered Capela useless. \_\_\_ >Bam Adebayo helped sink the Celtics. Bam Adebayo was *a beast against the Celtics,* but we were also featuring Daniel Theis at 6'8, who's also a small ball center himself. The refs also seemed to love calling fouls on Theis, and we had terrible depth. Honestly, I'm not going to make excuses, but I think we had a better team on paper, but failed to execute. Credit to to Miami for doing their job. &#x200B; >Anthony Davis was a defensive force. Who still shouldn't be playing the 5, although that's his ideal position in the modern NBA. The problem is his inability to stay healthy plus being banged up against the bigger bulkier 5's is not a good plan for his health moving forward. That's why the Lakers have been intent in getting someone like a Drummond or Gasol to spell him at those minutes. >In 2021 though, arguably what we're seeing is the rise of Big ball centers -- guys with some offensive skills but whose role is really to play D and PLAY BIG. Three of the four teams left count on guys who are Big Ball centers -- Ayton, whose a mobile 7 footer and the talk of the playoffs, Lopez, a sweet shooting big man who can box out and defend well, and Clint Capela, whose as close to a poor man's clone of Dwight Howard as any in the league. This is a big difference than from last year. I'm defining the big ball center by what they do on D not O, btw. Yeah, but a lot of these bigs all benefit greatly from a team that has a solid PnR partner in Trae Young/CP3/Booker. I will say Lopez is different, because he has changed his shot profile to help space the floor. &#x200B; >Superstar/Hybrid Centers have done well this playoffs, but if you ask them to do too much on offense, you didn't get out of the second round There's a common trend in these superstar centers not making it out of the second round, and **that can be attributed to missing their 2nd options or lack of one,** (Simmons, Murray, Irving/Harden.) Irving/Harden were in and out, and Harris/Aaron Gordon/Tobias Harris all played below their expectations. Your role players and 2nd stars need to show up to win. There's just too many talented teams that have plenty of depth and pieces to make it a tough series. (Hawks/Suns.) &#x200B; >Rudy Gobert took the heat for Utah losing, but the reality is is that injuries caught up to the team's guards.   >   >We all just like to make fun of him and it's okay, he should gain a thicker skin. This one's been done ad nauseam. Just remember -- to lose a 26 point lead, both your defense and offense must fail, and considering Reggie Jackson and Terrance Mann suddenly went super saiyan, from all over the court, while Don Mitchell just couldn't score anymore, I put that lost squarely on the guards of the team, and then on Rudy. Wouldn't be shocked if their injuries are worse than we think. Gobert can't solve the Jazz's weak perimeter defenders constantly giving up corner 3's, he defended pretty well. Terance Man just went ham, tip your hat off to him. When Gobert's forced to switch out and you're taking away and negating his shot blocking abilities, but you cannot also be happy with how passive at times, Gobert was whenever there was a smaller defender on him. Gobert is getting paid $40 million, he needs to learn maybe some basic post moves. Ayton, being switched on Morris would've been a field day for him. &#x200B; >The Suns are a young team but play like an old team, they don't turn the ball over that much and that will likely be a big reason they beat the Clippers, if they beat the Clippers.   >   >When I predicted the Lakers to go over the Suns in the first round, I was relying on old logic -- young teams don't win, even in wacky seasons. Well, that's because young teams have a tendency to self combust, turning the ball over under pressure, not knowing who should shoot on the last play, having some chemistry issues, etc. That and the Lakers thrived off teams turning the ball over last season, turning Russell Westbrook's dribbling into a liability, something that led to transition and then AD putting the other team in foul trouble. Well... I was wrong! The Suns have legit none of those issues of young teams and are pretty careful with the basketball! One wonders if this due to CP3 being a basketball wizard and changing his approach with age and playing on that OKC team last season. I genuinely believe this is the net effect of CP3, he's one of those beyond the box score leader types. Young or old, it doesn't matter. They have the talent + experience. I think it's also a given at this point that players like Jae Crowder or CP3 help change the culture of the team. They are great leaders or role players that you can fit on any team.  It's no coincidence that Crowder or Trevor Ariza's been such a journeymen. Plenty of teams value dogs.",3,0.098,0.765,0.137,0.9941,3.37

For instance, there is a huge group of people that defend players like Westbrook, Giannis and Gobert despite the fact that they have come up short of expectations in the playoffs. Coaches such as Dwane Casey and Budenholzer were both very successful regular season coaches that came up short of expectations in the playoffs and have received almost unanimous disapproval because of their post season struggles.

Just to be clear, I put A LOT of value in the playoffs. I love play off basketball, and the teams I route for I don't want to just have a great regular season followed by a 1st round exit.

I think it also boils down to the fact that a coach's playoff adjustments' success seems pretty binary to the average fan -- it either works or doesn't. Taking the players you mentioned into account, all three of those guys have had perimeter-centric All-Stars who can create this ""gray area."" If someone else plays well (and even if the team loses), they just won't receive as much flak because it wasn't totally explicit and got overshadowed. For Gobert, I think Game 1 of the West semis was a great example of this. He struggled on offense and mostly had a limited defensive impact unlike his dominance in the regular season. But he got the game-winning block and Mitchell dropped 45, so his struggles just weren't as apparent. Then look at Bud, who got a ton of criticism even after beating the Nets in Game 7. The play he drew up at the end of regulation which ended in that horrible fadeaway baseline shot was entirely on him. Why? Because in a fan's eyes he's the singular guy in charge. Without anyone else visibly at his position (a star has teammates, a coach doesn't have a co-head coach), there's no other place to distribute blame that stems from a sideline mistake. A player on the other hand, isn't supposed to be ""the guy in charge."" If that were truly the case, they would probably (and rightfully) get the benefit of the doubt from not having any help.

If you get off to a horrific start, that’s enough to make a player or coach change. But if you roll along fine, have to deal with injuries, or stay at least competitive, it’s harder to judge off regular season.  Playoffs are a much more accurate gauge. That’s the moment you get to see coaches under pressure. How do they make adjustments? How do they handle adversity? Can they get the most out of their best players in the big moments when it matters?  Playoff results are much more telling for what a coach actually is. For example, guys like Mike Budenholzer and Doc Rivers have strange rotations that usually get picked apart. Coaches like Ty Lue are shown to be full of adjustments and making minutes count. Coaches like Spo and Pop find a way to get the most out of their players and run good systems when it matters.

For the 2019 and 2020 drafts, I think it's still too early to start determining who is the best player in each draft. Nobody from either of these drafts has even had the chance to play a full season.

I found 11 1st overall picks that were no doubt the best player in their draft:

Dwight Howard

LeBron James

Yao Ming

Tim Duncan

Chris Webber

Shaquille O'Neal

David Robinson

Magic Johnson

David Thompson

Bill Walton

Lew Alcindor

There were 8 players that might have been the best player in their draft, but there either wasn't a standout player, or someone else was very close:

|Draft|Player|Other(s) Considered|
--:|:--|:--|
|2016|Ben Simmons|Jaylen Brown|
|2015|Karl-Anthony Towns|Devin Booker|
|2012|Anthony Davis|Damian Lillard|
|2000|Kenyon Martin|Michael Redd, Jamal Crawford|
|1985|Patrick Ewing|Karl Malone|
|1983|Ralph Sampson|Clyde Drexler|
|1982|James Worthy|Dominique Wilkins|
|1968|Elvin Hayes|Wes Unseld|

Every other player was clearly not the best player in their draft IMO. While you *might* be able to argue for some of them being closer than a one or two I personally have listed in the maybe category, none really have an argument for being the best. You might think that some guys shouldn't be on my maybe list, but the main question I'm asking is who (if any) belong on the best player of their draft list?

If I had to pick, I'd say Simmons, Davis, and Worthy were all the best players in their draft, and the other guys weren't, but I'm not 100% on that opinion. 

*prior to 1966, the NBA still had territorial picks. For example, Bob Boozer was technically the first pick of the 1959 draft because Philly used a controversial territorial pick on Wilt Chamberlain, who was by far the best prospect and would have been taken with the first pick if available.

Secondly my analysis comes from everything James wanted in Houston vs what he could have had.

1. Chris Paul. CP3 and Harden were a great tandem till their personal relationship broke down. James wanted him out and Morey pulled the trigger and sent him to OKC. Now CP3 is leading the young suns into the WCF.

2. Clint Capela. This guy was an elite rebounder for James and he opened up his offense. If James missed a shot Clint was there to keep the offense going. Clint had to be moved since him and Russ clogged the court for James. Now Clint is helping the Hawks in the ECF with another free shooter in Ice Trae.

3. PJ Tucker. James always didn’t like how he didn’t have superstar talent next to him but PJ is a horse. One of the hardest working players in the league and a 3 point shooter. Now he’s in the ECF with the Bucks.

4. Mike D’Antoni. James loved MDA since he turned him from a good scorer to an elite one. MDA coddled him and the team into believing they could sacrifice easy 2 for 3 point shots. Harden followed him to Brooklyn and now they are watching from home. 

5. Daryl Morey. Another guy who coddled James. DM was never afraid to make a risky move that helped James win a title. When he left James wanted out. Now DM is stuck with Ben Simmons trying to prove he can win with Morey ball.

6. Brooklyn Nets. James finally gets his super team but he joins an often injured KD and Kyrie. It ends up not working this season due to his and Kyries injury.

7. Rafael Stone. James didn’t want to give Stone a chance in building a team around him. Stone could have offloaded Russ to the Knicks for expiring contracts to start the rebuild but he went for John Wall to give Harden a chance to consider staying here. Stone got ridiculed for not trading James for Ben Simmons but now it looks like it worked out for the Rockets as they aren’t stuck with Ben and we have the #2 pick.

8. Stephen Silas. This is a coach who James wouldn’t give a chance to. Didn’t show up to training camp. Turns out the players love him and even ex players like Luka Doncic are a starting to realize how important he was.

9. Christian Wood. A player that James really needed. A pick and pop big that he could have used in the playoffs that he didn’t want to give a chance to.

I’m not saying if James stayed we win a title this year. I’m just saying all the reasons he wanted out are starting to hurt his legacy.","t3_o70n95","https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/o70n95/the_playoffs_this_year_is_a_testament_to_james/",3,1,"t1_h3i922y","2021-29-06 5:51:28 PM","What a run though!

"nbadiscussion","orwll","Takeaways from Bucks-Hawks Game 2?","2021-25-06 9:10:42 PM","Some theories/thoughts I have: 

* The main way teams have exploited the Bucks drop coverage is outside shooting, but the Hawks haven't been a good three point shooting team this playoffs. Trae is a good difficult shot maker, but he's also streaky- nights like this 1-8 aren't entirely out of the norm. 
* The Bucks did a good job taking away Trae's playmaking and forcing turnovers. 3 assists and 9 turnovers is a really bad game for him. The Hawks don't have that reliable second guy who can create his own shot, so much of their roster depends on Trae's playmaking or Trae's gravity to draw defensive attention. I thought Brook Lopez in particular did a really great job on Trae. 
* The trend of Giannis taking fewer jumpshots = better performance continues. He shot eight shots outside the restricted area tonight, and was 2-8 on those shots. That move on Hill/Capela was really alluring, I think everyone would rather he adds to his arsenal of post moves than keep working on his outside shooting. 
* I think the Bucks' drop coverage did a good job of taking away Trae's shots at the rim. He only took four shots in the paint tonight, and all were on the very edges, none in the restricted area. Last game, he attempted fourteen shots in the paint, and six in the restricted area. Trae only shot three free throws tonight, possibly because he was shooting more from deep and not attacking the rim.","t3_o83iac","https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/o83iac/takeaways_from_buckshawks_game_2/",32,11,"t1_h34wt9y","2021-26-06 12:25:42 PM","Game 2 was an extreme version of how I expected the series would go. Bucks would force the Hawks into difficult shots, get into passing lanes and get into transition.  The Bucks probably won't shoot 60 percent from three in a half again, but if they shoot ~40 percent that just means they win by 10 instead of 30. The Hawks transition defense was a huge problem even against Philly and the Bucks are even tougher on the break. This is the definitely the season for huge series turnarounds, but I don't see it for the Hawks this time. They can steal another game if Lou Will catches fire, or Giannis gets into foul trouble, but barring further injuries I have a hard time picturing them beating the Bucks three more times.",5,0.161,0.71,0.129,-0.7169,2.79

In 97' they replaced Shaq with a 17/10 center and fell to 45-37 and were bounced in the first round, despite an epic series from Penny.

In 2007 Wade missed considerable time. How did Miami do with Shaq, without Wade? 16-8. How about Miami with Wade, without Shaq? 18-17.

You can do this over and over again for Shaq. The fact is his teams were average without him. Even when his superstar wings were out Shaq kept the team performing at an elite level; when he was out both Kobe and Wade failed to do the same. Penny was not able to do it in 97'.

Also, Shaq's longevity is so underrated on this site and many others.

People use Big O and Magic to devalue him ignoring that in thirteen seasons those guys played in their careers without him not once did they win a chip. I never hear anyone bring up 89-90 when all the elements of Showtime were intact and many in their prime except Kareem (who already was diminished from even a few years prior) had retired and they’d drafted Divac who had a solid rookie campaign. But that small change at one position took Lakers from the Finals three years in a row to losing in five in the Conference Semis. All the evidence is that Kareem was more and not less important to Showtime than most think yet many still try to argue he’s less important than many think. I think it’s the same way with Shaq. People have this habit of talking about favoring “greatest peak” over greatest career yet no one ever talks about Shaq having arguably greatest individual season to result in a championship in 99-00 when talking about “greatest peak”.

They were both traded for each other on draft day. They both play PG (or at the very least, Luka's usually the lead ballhandler and playmaker). They are both known for their playmaking and general offensive prowess (over their athleticism and defensive chops). They are both touted as the face of their respective franchises, now and in the upcoming seasons. You get the picture.

Difference is, one is on a team that is in the remaining four franchises still vying for a championship this season, while the other is in offseason mode. I'd just like to get your opinions on their situations. Could it be due to the players themselves? Is it the lack of a true co-star for Luka (KP vs Collins)? Is it the construction for the rest of the team? Is it coaching? Is it the FO or the rest of the organization? Or could it be something more external, like the odd predicament the league is in right now (injury-riddled, to say the least) or that the East is weaker than the West (or some combination of match-ups they had along the way)?

Again, I'm not saying any of these are the real reasons, but I'd like to see whether or not there are big reasons to the difference, or if it was all by chance.

(Since we're already talking about the Hawks, I'd just like to share that it's funny to think that a few seasons ago Collins and Ayton were both handed suspensions yet are now closer to the chip than they've ever been in their careers.

Obviously I'm not denying the positive impacts CP3 has had on the suns, but when people start putting him in the MVP convo is where I draw the line. Don't think anybody will argue 16-5-9 regular season stats are MVP numbers. Booker was better than CP3 all season, and now Booker and Ayton are both better than CP3 in the playoffs.

CP3 was injured and played like trash in the first round against LAL and the suns were fine without him. In the current series against the LAC, PHX again won 2 games without him.

When people say ""last year PHX was 10th and this year they're 2nd and in the WCF with him"" I feel is a very misleading statement. It would be like saying last year ATL was 14th and this year theyre 5th and in the ECF, therefore Bogdanovic is the MVP.

In response, Doc said it wouldn't be much different this season cause Ty Lue was sitting right next to him. Well clearly that was nonsense. Never seen a head coach throw his assistant coach under the bus to avoid responsibility for his own bad decisions, especially after that same coach took his job.

Makes it a lot more apparent how much Doc blames other people for his own failures after the Sixers lost and he tried to say that Ben needs to get in the gym, even tho he said earlier in the season that he didn't need to pressure Ben to shoot the ball. But now when he doesn't shoot, it's his fault? What kind of coach throws his own player under the bus after blatantly refusing to coach him on his most important issue, and his most dangerous liability? Ben deserves his own criticism but for Doc Rivers to purposely neglect the issue and then act surprised is unacceptable.

Quite frankly, I think Doc is a spineless, pathetic excuse of a coach who never takes responsibility for anything.

Here is some analysis on how tonight’s game might go in Atlanta.

The Bucks have seemed figure out how to fluster the Hawks on defense. They put pressure on Trae by eliminating his space off the PnR and helping off of the perimeter. This was a key adjustment from game 1 where Milwaukee looked to stay home and let Trae beat them off of high-percentage floater looks.

Atlanta has to get really creative on offense, and they need great production from either of their secondary scoring options (Huerter or Bogi). If Milwaukee continues to help off the perimeter (which they will), Huerter or Bogi should look to be aggressive scorers in order to make the Bucks pay.

Keep in mind, the result of Atlanta’s misses were primarily due to the Bucks defense rather than variance. To combat this, Atlanta should look to fix their spacing issues with the John Collins and Clint Capella pairing. Capella isn’t a shooter, so a Trae/JC PnR isn’t an effective game plan since Capella’s defender is gonna help in the paint. They can try to rely on the Trae/Capella PnR, but Milwaukee is going to continue to sell out and help off of JC. I expect Collins to put up a bunch of threes today.

Offensively, the Bucks still don’t have much to worry about. Maybe Atlanta can try the wall, but they have attempted this and their wall is effective with defenders Bogi and Gallo. Their perimeter defenders weren’t aggressive enough in cutting off Giannis’s driving lanes. If they are more aggressive, however, the Bucks should resort to putting Giannis in screener situations and open up scoring opportunities for Jrue/Middleton as ball handlers.

Milwaukee probably will not shoot as efficiently as they did in game 2. However, they did not sway the game from the shooting; it was the defense and Giannis being aggressive in the paint. Also, they lost by 40 points, that tells you they were outmatched on both sides of the ball.

I expect the Bucks to continue the aggressive help on Trae, which will open up opportunities for Atlanta’s wings. He should become more of a willing passer out of the PnR, and their wings will have more production offensively - the only question is if they can score at an efficient rate. Collins will attempt more three point shots since Giannis tends to help off of him.

Overall, my prediction is the Bucks win somewhere around 10-15, with another big game from Jrue and Middleton getting into a groove. Let me know how you think this one goes!","t3_o94wng","https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/o94wng/bucks_vs_hawks_game_3_analysis_predictions_things/",148,8,"t1_h3ax1kn","2021-28-06 2:16:33 AM","I personally feel like the only way the bucks can lose this series is if they shoot themselves in the foot which they did in game 1.

"nbadiscussion","krs196","Stars that may be traded that may be surprising.","2021-09-07 2:44:45 PM","This summer, with the free agency market lacking big time, it seems likely most teams will try to improve via the draft or trade.

And while this draft has some legit star talent at the top you may see one or two teams trade a older star to get, most will try to get a star from a trade.

I was working out who may be available, including people we may not expect. We have all heard about maybe Simmons or Lillard and Beal seems like he'll be an option, at least in people's heads, so if any of them got traded it really wouldn't be too surprising.

So the question became: **Is there anyone who has an actual possible shot of being traded (i.e. not Doncic nonsense trades) that may not be someone people expect but - in a market that may see teams bidding against each other and thus, driving up prices on talent - could still be dealt?**

Here's a list of people I think qualify for this:

- **KAT**

**Why yes**: The Wolves have been/are perpetually kind of a mess. I'm not sure where I'd rank KAT in the NBA, atm, but I can see a team talking themselves into his potential to improve (whether its there or not). 

The Wolves may decide to truly blow everything up and shed salary as they try to sell the team. Also, with all that's happened in his life during the pandemic, he may just want a change of scenery.

**Why no**: He may like the low-key nature of Minny, and with all that has happened in his life, he may enjoy playing with his friend D-Lo more than leaving for somewhere else. Also, while a lot of new owners like blowing things up, KAT is still young enough to be a building block.

**Possible teams**:

**Knicks** - They have Mitch, but I think KAT has more potential and it would allow him to be closer to his hometown. It could be a move for the Knicks where they get someone with star potential without having to give up the farm.

**Jazz** - Jazz don't usually make flashy moves, but I think him and Gobert could coexist without getting in each other's way too much. KAT may like playing PF too and the Jazz could provide some franchise stability. It'd be a bit of an old-school lineup but sometimes going against the grain can surprise teams. Engles could be flexed where needed as well.

**Washington** - The Wizards thinking they are closer to conention than they are and deciding to keep everyone AND deciding to give up way too much for KAT wouldn't even register as surprising to me.

- **Jrue Holiday**

**Why yes**: While Jrue did well for them, if they don't like how the Finals go down and can package him in a deal for a better player, they may go for it.

**Why no**: He has played well for them during the season, and the Bucks would likely make a coaching change before overhauling big parts of the roster. Also, sunk cost fallacy.

**Possible teams**:

**Blazers** - This would be an improvement. Blazers could take him on as part of a package and figure to trade him later or try to contend still now. Lillard with Giannis and Middleton would be scary, but issue is what else can Bucks give at this point in a trade?

**Depth** - I'm putting this here to encompass a number of possibilities with the basic idea being that maybe they can get 3 players that, while none are as good as Jrue, together they can help the team more.

- **Chris Paul**

**Why yes**: The Suns may end up winning the title, but Chris isn't getting younger and if some team wants to throw $100 mil.+ at him, the Suns may be appreciative of his help but not stupid.

With Booker, Bridges, Ayton, the Suns will be contenders still in the future, especially if they can get a decent haul. With a sign and trade, Paul could go to a team he wants, even if they don't have the cap room to get him in free agency.

Sarver may not want to pay high-dollar for their core 4.

**Why no**: Umm, the Suns are two games from the their first Finals victory ever. It's easy to assume the  Suns young talent will continue to improve, but it's not always a given, and so why screw things up now?

**Possible teams**:

**Knicks** - He's expressed desire to play their before and he could really help them make a deeper playoff push. If he's willing to take a 3 yr deal for say 90 mil., and the Knicks don't have to give up more than a couple of assets, I could see this being possible for them.

**Bucks** - Remember what I said about the Jrue improvement? This could be a way to improve with the limited assets Bucks still have.

**Lakers** - I don't think the Lakers can be ruled out this off-season from big moves, and it wouldn't surprise me if Paul hits that sweet spot of they have enough to get him/him being a big help for the team.

Though, it's possible the Suns don't want to help a title rival, they may also recognize that rival would be  built in part around some admittedly older stars.

- **Siakam**

**Why yes**: This goes back to what I said at the start; while the Raptors may not be inclined to trade him, if enough teams want to get stupid about it, they may decide he has platued and it's worth it to trade him while they can get so much.

**Why no**: It may just be he's better as a 2nd star and the Raptors like the core they have and want to build with him still, because again, despite any narratives atm, he's really good.

**Possible teams**:

**Warriors** - We've seen the rumored offer, but it really depends on how much the Raptors like Wiseman.

**Mavs** - I could see Dallas sending 4 firsts or more and Kristaps to get him in the type of move other contenders have made for stars. Would it be the right move for them? Ehhh, maybe?

While Kemba, Kristaps, McCollum all may be traded, they aren't on the level of the others above.

One team to watch out for: **The Hawks**.

The Hawks are ready to take the leap but are superstar hunting at this point, and have the assets to do so. I think they wait though until next off-season and see if the situations with Embiid, Giannis, or Doncic implode first before making all-in move.

I think they’re probably trying hard to get Simmons with DLo but if he is traded it has to be a blockbuster trade almost AD like. With the injuries and his lack of support, people have forgotten how good he is but I think nearly every team would want to trade for him if he is available. 2) They put like 4/5 picks for Jrue, they aren’t trading him but he just hasn’t got it going offensively. CJ could be an interesting fit as they do need a more offensive playmaker but with his contract it’s not really a positive contract where they can get back great depth too. 3) CP3 is a Free Agent and he’s going to chase the money which he rightfully should. Suns would be stupid to let him go and I think they’ll give him that and they’ll run it back. CP3 would be great with Middleton/Giannis but Suns aren’t taking on Jrue. Lakers have no chance of CP3 even Lowry and I’m a Lakers fan.  4). Siakam is in that FVV/Boucher timeline, I don’t see why Raptors would trade him unless for a young potential superstar. Dallas have time on their side with Luka has to be a calculated play and I don’t think Siakam moves the needle enough to sacrifice that many assets",11,0.101,0.705,0.194,0.9792,5.9399999999999995
"nbadiscussion","philabuster34","The playoffs this year is a testament to James Harden’s legacy.","2021-24-06 6:15:22 AM","First off, I am a huge James fan and if anyone wants to slander him and come down to Houston and throw fists please let me know.

Secondly my analysis comes from everything James wanted in Houston vs what he could have had.

1. Chris Paul. CP3 and Harden were a great tandem till their personal relationship broke down. James wanted him out and Morey pulled the trigger and sent him to OKC. Now CP3 is leading the young suns into the WCF.

2. Clint Capela. This guy was an elite rebounder for James and he opened up his offense. If James missed a shot Clint was there to keep the offense going. Clint had to be moved since him and Russ clogged the court for James. Now Clint is helping the Hawks in the ECF with another free shooter in Ice Trae.

3. PJ Tucker. James always didn’t like how he didn’t have superstar talent next to him but PJ is a horse. One of the hardest working players in the league and a 3 point shooter. Now he’s in the ECF with the Bucks.

4. Mike D’Antoni. James loved MDA since he turned him from a good scorer to an elite one. MDA coddled him and the team into believing they could sacrifice easy 2 for 3 point shots. Harden followed him to Brooklyn and now they are watching from home. 

5. Daryl Morey. Another guy who coddled James. DM was never afraid to make a risky move that helped James win a title. When he left James wanted out. Now DM is stuck with Ben Simmons trying to prove he can win with Morey ball.

6. Brooklyn Nets. James finally gets his super team but he joins an often injured KD and Kyrie. It ends up not working this season due to his and Kyries injury.

7. Rafael Stone. James didn’t want to give Stone a chance in building a team around him. Stone could have offloaded Russ to the Knicks for expiring contracts to start the rebuild but he went for John Wall to give Harden a chance to consider staying here. Stone got ridiculed for not trading James for Ben Simmons but now it looks like it worked out for the Rockets as they aren’t stuck with Ben and we have the #2 pick.

8. Stephen Silas. This is a coach who James wouldn’t give a chance to. Didn’t show up to training camp. Turns out the players love him and even ex players like Luka Doncic are a starting to realize how important he was.

9. Christian Wood. A player that James really needed. A pick and pop big that he could have used in the playoffs that he didn’t want to give a chance to.

I’m not saying if James stayed we win a title this year. I’m just saying all the reasons he wanted out are starting to hurt his legacy.","t3_o70n95","https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/o70n95/the_playoffs_this_year_is_a_testament_to_james/",3,1,"t1_h3i922y","2021-29-06 5:51:28 PM","What a run though!

From the 1993 to 2005 Season, Shaq averaged 67 games per Season. **For the first scenario I will do the following:**

1. In the final six Seasons of his career, I’m going to continue to use 67 games each year.

2. Plays 70 games per Season for his remaining seven Seasons (after 2005).
3. Decreased his ppg by 1ppg each year instead of 1.5.

&#x200B;

My observations:

1. Gobert has to help on PG, otherwise that's an easy lay up for PG. Donovan has to switch to the corner 3. He doesn't even make an effort to close out to T Mann. That's just poor effort from Donovan. He retreats out to Batum when he should have gone to the corner spot. That would have led to a pass to Batum, at which point Bojan has to rotate to Batum, which then would have led to a pass to Morris and Conley should rotate out to Morris. Finally, Morris would probably make the open pass to Reggie but at that point, O'Neale would have to rotate out to Reggie. By this time, there's probably 8-10 secs left on the clock and the ball wouldn't be moving as much. If you're the Jazz, this is 100% the better option as opposed to leaving Mann open at the corner 3 spot. Key thing here is rotation, rotation and rotation.
2. Again, Gobert comes to help. Nothing wrong with that. However, it's not on Gobert to close out to Mann. That's on Donovan again. You kind of have to split the difference between Mann and Batum, but the way Donovan is positioned, he's more concerned about Batum. Just look at all that space when Reggie makes the pass. Pay attention to when the ball bounces on the floor on the way to Mann's shooting pocket. Again, Donovan doesn't even try to close out to the corner shooter. Poor effort yet again. Gobert is in such a bad spot. If he closes out hard, he might foul Mann in the shooting motion.
3. Good defence by Gobert to start. I feel like Donovan should have taken another step closer to Batum and not be close to Reggie the moment Reggie passes to Batum. Batum is a smart player. He probably realized Donovan wouldn't contest the shot so he lets it fly. This is not on Gobert, this is on Donovan yet again. No effort for the third straight 3 pt shot with him being the closest defender each and every time.
4. Closest defender to Mann is Ingles, not Gobert. Ingles has to split the difference here, not be that close to Morris. Pause at the very moment Mann is just about to catch the ball and when he begins his shot wind up. Ingles is walking back. What kind of defence is this? How can you pin this on Gobert? Again, if he closes out too hard, he might foul Mann. This play is on Ingles. You have to split the difference here. By doing so, this allows O'Neale to swing to the wing spot to guard/contest Morris.
5. Same thing as 4. While Ingles did a better job at splitting the difference, he should have fully committed to contesting Mann's shot. O'Neale has to rotate out to Morris. Morris probably would have passed to PG up top at which point Conley would have to rotate out to PG. This would have left about 4-6 secs left on the clock. With Conley guarding PG, you take take any day (considering there would have been 4-6 secs left) over leaving a corner 3 shooter wide open.
6. Effort more so than anything. Clarkson has to close out faster than this. Either Clarkson fully commits to contesting the 3 by swinging right by him (not this half-assed close out) or he sprints fast enough and scares/stunts on Reggie and forces the Clippers to start the play all over again. Pause at the moment Reggie is in the shooting motion with the ball right over his head (right when the shot clock resets to 14). Look at how much space Reggie has. I don't even know what to say at this point. Everything I described so far leading up to point 6 comes down to two things: rotations and effort. Let's continue.
7. Hands up O'Neale, hands up!!! Pause at 4.9 secs left on the clock. Reggie is ready to let it fly. Ball in the shooting pocket and knees bent, all signs pointing to shooting the ball. Come on O'Neale. He has to assume that Reggie is gonna shoot. Chances are, Reggie is not gonna drive right and run in to Gobert. He's waiting to shoot. Put your hands up Royce!
8. Gobert is a split second late. He was in the paint for a split second longer than he needed to be. He's way too flat footed here. He has to properly contest this shot. Jump high and contest the shot man, come on.
9. Donovan completely lost track of the corner man. Donovan retreats out to Luke and forgets Pat Bev is in the corner. You HAVE to split the difference in these situations. If Donovan properly closes out to Pat Bev, he would have passed to Luke and Bojan would have to split the difference/rotate out to Luke. Once again, Donovan's lack of awareness is on full display.
10. I feel like for the most part, Gobert has good positioning to contest PG's shot but again, he has to jump higher and have his hands raised high. His right hand is tilted downwards when it should be pointed up high. The goal here is to disrupt PG's vision on the shot attempt. Better/stronger close out was needed. PG has way too much space to get the shot off.
11. Bojan is surveying his side of the court which is great. As soon as PG is about to make the pass, notice how his head is turned backwards/over his left shoulder towards Mann at the 17 sec mark. He probably thought Mann was going to drive/cut to the basket. Even if Mann attempts to drive/cut to the basket, Gobert is sitting in the paint. Bojan has to be two steps closer to Batum here. Gobert has to take ownership and communicate with Bojan by telling him to be closer to Batum, not Mann. 1. This right here is a lack of awareness by Bojan and Gobert.
12. Conley starts off by splitting the difference between Mann and Batum. This is what you want. Otherwise, Mann will be left completely open. You want to force Mann into making a decision - do I shoot or pass to my guy Batum? Conley gambles here by trying to steal the ball. You can only respect the effort here. However, when the pass goes out to Mann, Conley doesn't even make an attempt at closing out. He just gave up here. Complete lack of effort to end the defensive play. Why Conley? You did so well to start. You split the difference and attempted to steal the ball. Why did you just give up at the end?
13. Heat check shot by Pat Bev really. What more can you do here? For starters, get your hands up Bojan. You're daring Pat Bev to shoot, this is what you get.
14. Same thing as point 10. Gobert has to have his right hand up higher. Look at where his right hand is. It seems like his right hand palm is at eye-level. It has to be high above your head. You got a long reach, use it! Wtf you doing with this half-assed attempt at closing out? You want to disrupt Pat Bev's vision here.

Notice a trend here? Most of these plays, there was a defensive breakdown. Rotations were missed. Effort was missing. That's on the coach and the defensive anchor Rudy to tell his guys where they need to be. You see how Draymond is always yelling out to his guys where they need to be? Yea, that's more like it. What's one player that sticks out the most in all these plays above? Donovan Mitchell. He has poor awareness, vision and effort on the defensive side. Clippers were not only trying to exploit Gobert, they were trying to exploit Donovan too.

The problem is really the fact that the Utah defense was built without guys who could put up any sort of resistance on the perimeter. Basically they spent all year not worrying about if guys would blow by their perimeter because Gobert would clean it up. Some of those defensive rotations are really bad. The lack of awareness by Donovan in the second clip is just brutal.  The problem might be that even if Donovan splits the offensive players properly (or even cheats towards the corner, which is probably the right play since Bogdanovich can cover the two players up top), he's only 6'1 and is going to struggle to meaningfully contest shots from Terrence Mann, who has four inches on him. But he's got to try.  Donovan's young enough that I'd expect his defensive awareness to improve on plays like this, but the fact that the defensive awareness and rotations were consistently so bad means some of the blame has to fall on the coach.",2,0.133,0.777,0.09,-0.9201,2.4

The 5 Biggest Stock Risers During These NBA Playoffs

The NBA is interesting because during the regular season, fans and media members overreact to players’ performances and form their “player rankings”, only for the playoffs to come around and completely dismantle the aforementioned ranking system. I say this to make the point that when we TRULY think about who the best players in the world are, we need to more heavily consider what they do in May, June and July as opposed to what they do when half of the teams are load managing. For example, take a guy like Julius Randle. He made 3rd team all-NBA (as he should have) because he had a remarkable regular season, leading a Knicks team that played their hearts out in all 72 of their games and earned a 4 seed in the competitive Eastern Conference. However, when the playoff came around and the intensity was heightened, Randle didn’t look like himself. He couldn’t overpower people in the paint anymore, he didn’t create as much space to shoot his mid-range, and he didn’t shoot the ball well from anywhere on the court. Randle is a great player, but he’s not a top 15 NBA player yet - not even close - and it’s because of what he’s done (or hasn’t done) in the most important games that an NBA player can play. Playoff games. 

Note: When ranking the biggest playoff stock risers, I’m considering two main components: 

1) How much better the player performs in the playoffs as opposed to the regular season and 

2) How much more recognition a player gets during the playoffs as opposed to during the regular season (most often a result of a certain team not playing many nationally televised games or not playing in a big market, among other reasons).

5) Kevin Huerter

Kevin Huerter’s rise is definitely a testament in part to the 2nd ranking criteria; he plays in a small market (ATL) and is an unassuming, young player who was drafted in the same draft as Trae Young (and therefore has been overshadowed in the early part of his career). However, this man can flat out BALL, and it’s been a pleasure to watch him flourish in these playoffs. First of all, he’s 6 foot 7 and a good athlete. Yes, a good athlete. He gets super high on his jump shot, and it allows him to EASILY get shots up on shorter players, both out of the post and in the pick and roll; if you didn’t get a chance to watch ATL-PHI game 7, check out Huerter’s highlights from that game in which he absolutely exposes the Sixers (specifically Seth Curry) in the mid-range. He doesn’t just have the pull-up in his bag, though, he also has an underrated handle which allows him to get to multiple different spots on the court. We’ve seen him defended by some of the best defenders in the league during these playoffs (Jrue Holiday and Ben Simmons) and still be able to handle the rock under pressure and physicality. The ability to get to spots in the mid range and rise up to hit shots consistently is something that’s sustainable to build an offensive game around (we’ve seen guys like Beal, Booker, Durant, Middleton, and MANY OTHERS do it already), and Huerter is in an excellent position to do it as well, especially considering he’s only 22 years old. Huerter has also shown a solid ability to make plays for others. He has a high level understanding of offense and is always decisive and confident in his moves and passes, allowing him to be a secondary playmaker for the Hawks during this postseason. If you diligently watched the Hawks this postseason, you’ve probably seen a few of his cross court, lefty passes off the dribble. That’s high level stuff. Finally, Huerter plays on BOTH ENDS of the court! He’s shown some incredible fight while having to defend the likes of Tobias Harris, Ben Simmons, Jrue Holiday, Khris Middleton, and many other talented offensive players. He’s just a really good athlete with long arms who plays his butt off on that end and isn’t afraid to be physical and put his body on the line.  

4) Cameron Payne 

Cam Payne’s first claim to fame in the NBA was for his pregame dance routines with Russell Westbrook. Also, he was literally playing in China 2 years ago, and on multiple D-League teams before that, so it’s safe to say he definitely wasn’t on the average NBA fan’s radar prior to this postseason. He’s had an unbelievable turnaround, though, and he is about to get absolutely paid when he becomes a free agent next season. Payne has this special bounce in his step that I haven’t really seen before; he looks like he could be shot out of a cannon at any point and glide his way to the hoop. He’s also got a really nice floater game around the basket, and he can finish athletically with both hands and with control of his body at the rim. He pairs this with fantastic vision and a 6 foot 7 (!) wingspan, which makes him an unbelievable offensive threat. Before game 6 of the WCF (where CP3 assured all doubters that he is indeed the point God), there was a very persuasive case to be made that Cam Payne had been more effective than Chris Paul against LAC. This is because when CP3 was out of the lineup due to Covid, Payne took his game to a whole new level. We saw a confidence and comfortability that we hadn’t seen before with him, probably because he finally got the start and played big, important minutes. I had thought that maybe he would lose that bounce in his step over the course of a 48 minutes game if he was tasked with playing starting point guard minutes. Perhaps, I had thought, he was only that energetic because he comes in for 6 minute bursts. Well, I was dead wrong. Payne was as spry as he’s looked throughout these entire playoffs in games 1 and 2 of the WCF against LAC, and it has most definitely earned him a starting point guard spot in his near future, whether it be with Phoenix or another team. He’s going to get offered big money from an organization in free agency, much like Terry Rozier was offered a massive contract by the Hornets after his huge playoff performance with the Celtics in their 2018 playoff run to the conference finals. Payne has proven himself to be an impact player who deserves a firm spot in an NBA starting lineup, as well as a much larger contract than his current one (2 years, $2.1mil). The days of Cam Payne being “the guy who dances” are over, and he’s here to stay. He’ll be dancing ON the court from now on... 

3) Dillon Brooks

I must admit that I’m definitely considering the play-in games in conjunction with the playoff games when ranking these players, whether that’s logical or not. But guess what? I’m writing the article, so there’s unfortunately nothing you can do about it, unless you’d like to leave me a nasty comment at the bottom of this article. If Brooks and the Grizzlies had somehow found a way to surpass the Jazz, and Brooks had continued playing the way he was, there’s a very real possibility that Brooks would have been number one on this list. The Dillon Brooks that we saw in both the play-ins and the play-offs is a two way STUD that we didn’t have the pleasure of witnessing during the regular season nearly enough due to him playing in Memphis and therefore being overshadowed by both Ja and Jonas, not to mention playing in a small market. He’s got one of the better motors I’ve seen in the NBA, and it allows him to be a pest on defense like not many others can. He guards the best player on the other team in virtually every game MEM plays, and he WANTS IT, too. He loves the competition, he loves getting in your grill and making you miserable for 94 feet, and he loves being physical. In other words, his game (specifically on the defensive end) is tailor-made to the playoffs. On the offensive end, Brooks showed unbelievable strides in his skillset during the playoffs. He’s 6 foot 7 and 225 pounds, and he’s got a surprisingly polished offensive game. Like Huerter, he has a solid handle and can get to his spots in the mid-range and just rise up, which allows him to shoot over defenders with ease. He’s a lot stronger going to the hoop than Huerter, though, and he’s got a real knack for finishing around the rim with a number of different push-type shots with both hands. Finally, he can hit the three point shot, which forces defenses to guard him on the perimeter, therefore opening up room for Brooks to attack the paint. If Brooks continues his development on the offensive end, I really think he can turn into one of the best two-way players in the NBA. He averaged 25.8 points in this postseason against a very solid Jazz defense, and there’s no question he’s already one of the toughest perimeter defenders to go up against in the league. He’s only going to continue to improve, and he’s a name that you’re going to hear in the all-star conversation next year.

2) Trae Young

If you had any gripe with Trae Young being considered a superstar before the playoffs, you can no longer have that gripe. I mean, you can, you would just be very wrong. Trae Young has a few offensive qualities that, when paired together, make him virtually impossible to stop. The first thing he has is a great shooting touch from range; you can’t leave him with a step, or else he’ll get his three off quickly and will kill you. This forces defenses to pick him up basically as soon as he walks over halfcourt (much like Curry or Lillard), and it forces them to go over screens as well. The second thing that Trae possesses is an unbelievable first step - probably the best in basketball. His change of speed and ability to burst by the defense is second to none in the NBA, and when paired with his ability to shoot, it allows him to drive with incredible ease; he had the 3rd most drives per game in the entire NBA this season, which is pretty remarkable for a scrawny guy like Trae. Trae also has the best floater game in the NBA (by far). He takes and makes the most floaters in the league, and he doesn’t really need any space or time to get it off, which makes it quite lethal. He’s also the best lob thrower in the NBA; his lob (the majority of the time to either Capela or Collins) looks exactly like his floater, too, so it makes the Hawks virtually impossible to defend once Trae gets in the painted area. When Trae throws the ball in the air, the defense is afraid to block it (because if it’s a floater, it could be called for goaltending), and that oftentimes results in an easy dunk for one of the athletic ATL front court players. When combining these three qualities (shooting touch, quick first step, and lethal floater/lob game), it makes Trae dominant offensively. It doesn’t end there, though. Trae has that killer instinct, which I think many people were surprised by; people thought that once the pressure intensified as it does during the playoffs, Trae would have a hard time dealing with it. Instead, however, Trae used the defenses’ over-aggression to his advantage, blowing by the defense and either getting fouled or getting to his floater/lob game. He talked trash to opposing players, opposing fans, and literally anyone who was willing to listen to him. Against PHI, not only did he play against one of the meanest fanbases in the league, but he was defended primarily by Ben Simmons and Matisse Thybulle, two incredibly tough and physical PLAYOFF defenders. He wasn’t phased in the slightest, and it was unbelievably fun to watch. Trae put the entire ATL team on his back throughout the entire playoffs, and he’s proven that he must be considered a top 5 NBA point guard.

"nbadiscussion","BrockSmashgood","New Idea for Playoffs","2021-03-07 10:49:37 AM","This is a way for teams to retain their stars and for playoffs to become even more exciting for fans. This idea will keep superstars in the playoffs for longer, so that there is more viewership. Plus it is a high risk, high reward type of playoffs tournament that becomes a must-watch event for fans. This will encourage teams even more, to make it to the playoffs. And star players will be less inclined to leave their team if they can win a ring, with or without their original teams. Obviously this idea is far fetched but could be super fun. 


Here it is:

Winner of each playoff series can select 1 player from losing opponent team to join them rest of the playoffs IF the losing team gives permission. Also, obviously the player that is selected to be loaned out has to give the okay.


The losing team can choose what they want to be awarded in exchange for ""loaning"" their player: a first round pick, cash considerations, second round picks, draft rights to overseas players, or a portion of cap space from winning team for following season (ex: winning team gives up 5 mil cap space for next season, losing team gets extra 5 mil cap space during the following year without penalty). 

If loaned players win the championship with the new team, he is awarded a ring and is counted as a champion in the history books, with no asterisks next to his name. 


Only players on their original teams can be loaned. So for example if the Bucks beat sixers and give up assets to get Embiid from Sixers, but Bucks lose to Nets in next round, Embiid can't be loaned to the Nets. 

Both teams involved in loaning a player must also agree to an injury compensation package in case the loaned player gets hurt. 

If the loaned player gets hurt and is out for the following season, his salary for following season is going to impact the winning team's cap space next season. Plus the team that loaned out the player will still need to receive their loan compensation and injury compensation which was agreed by both teams. 

For example: let's say the Bucks get Embiid on loan from Sixers after beating them in round one. Bucks give up a future first round pick to Sixers as compensation for getting Embiid for remainder of playoffs. Sixers demand second round picks as compensation if Embiid gets hurt. 

In the second round of playoffs, Embiid breaks his shoulder and is out for following year.

Bucks now lose cap space for following season equivalent to Embiids salary. Sixers get the injury compensation (2nd round picks) in addition to the first round pick as original compensation for loaning out Embiid.","t3_od2u0g","https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/od2u0g/new_idea_for_playoffs/",0,10,"t1_h41szlc","2021-04-07 11:42:00 AM","> The losing team can choose what they want to be awarded in exchange for ""loaning"" their player: a first round pick, cash considerations, second round picks, draft rights to overseas players, or a portion of cap space from winning team for following season (ex: winning team gives up 5 mil cap space for next season, losing team gets extra 5 mil cap space during the following year without penalty).

"nbadiscussion","AdmissionGSP","Career trajectory predictions for Ben Simmons?","2021-21-06 5:20:00 AM","Just because this may be interesting to return to in a couple of years, how do you see Ben Simmons's career playing out based on everything you know now.

Perenniall All-Star still? All-NBA? Top x player? All-Defense? MVP votes? A lot worse? Any good player comps?

FYI his usage rate, AST% and BPM has declined every year he's been in the league.

Personally, I think we will never see a version of Ben Simmons quite as bad as we just saw, but then again in 4 years in the league, Ben has shown very little improvement in the areas where he is critically flawed.

Physically and technically, there is no reason why he can't become an inferior/more pass-oriented version of Giannis, but mentally he really seems to be seriously challenged and too comfortable with deferring, which makes projection difficult.","t3_o4tt1c","https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/o4tt1c/career_trajectory_predictions_for_ben_simmons/",1,8,"t1_h2j5qu6","2021-21-06 5:55:49 AM","Still think he can be a consistent all-star caliber player as well as he is still talented and effective enough to make all-defensive teams imo. He is talented, a lot of it just seems mental and maybe Philly is a hard environment to work past that. I also don’t think that Embiid is a great pair for him. I don’t see the path for him getting there but I’m curious what he’d look like on a team like the Timberwolves who already have some great scorers and specifically a big man that can shoot really well from three. He’d have a really important, defined role on defense and could just be an offense initiator without needed to be called on to do much else on offense other then push pace. There are probably other teams that it could work on too but I’m just familiar with the Wolves. He has clear weaknesses but a lot of great players do. We just saw Giannis lead a team to the CF being just as bad as a FT shooter and without a shot. I wonder if a team could ever use him similarly to how Draymond has been used in GS.",8,0.077,0.734,0.188,0.9744,6.88

Would anyone watch basketball played NFL style, with Defensive / Offensive teams?

  
Kinda like half court playground games. take a free throw to determine who gets first possession. No winners or losers out. Each team gets 3 minutes to score however much they can. Team A's offensive 5 versus Team B's defensive 5. Then give the ball to the other team, their turn. Take a break after 12 minutes. 

Keep taking turns, keep adding the scores, similar to how they do it currently for the All Star Game, for each quarter scores. It might lead to impossibly large margins, like this year's All Star, but that's where the defense would really have to put their stamp on the game, to ensure the scores don't become too much for their offensive team to overcome. 

Would this allow specialists or extreme GOATs to really shine? Like, how much would Steph and co. be able to pour in the 3s on a quintet focused only on stopping him? Or, how much would a team of Ben Simmons type players cause havoc on an offense? Or would a really good Offensive / Defensive Coach be able to finally show his true value?

Players wouldn't get played off the court as they could simply focus on their primary strengths - offense or defense. We have situational subs now anyway, but in this case we'd have a longer time to be in that situation.

Also playing halfcourt takes away the athleticism and fast-break component of the game which helps makes basketball so exciting.  In this set up you would lose this entirely.   I also respect players that can be effective and great on both offense and defense. If you want to score at will on me at one end, try and stop me on the other end when I do the same to you.

1. The Hawks don’t have to give up too much to get him. As it stands now, in order to clear enough cap space to give him the max (~$39.35 mil.), the Hawks would only have to renounce all their cap holds (including John Collins’), and dump the salaries of Gallo, Kris Dunn, and Bruno Fernando; sending those contracts and a 2nd-rounder or two to OKC probably does the job. 

That isn’t nothing — Gallo and John Collins are good players — but that doesn’t compare to Kawhi’s value, and the Hawks get to keep their young wings (Reddish, Huerter, and Hunter) and their 1st for this year.


2. The Hawks have the pieces to build a contender right now. As is, the Hawks’ core of Young, Hunter, Bogdanovic, Huerter, Capela, and Reddish are already pretty good, and have proven that the playoffs aren’t too big for them. Adding Leonard makes the Hawks true title contenders, and that’s before them rounding out their roster with vet Free Agents using their MLE and BAE. The Hawks could realistically field a lineup of

PG: Young
SG: Bogdanovic
SF: Hunter
PF: Leonard
C:  Capela 

with a second unit of 

PG: Ish Smith
SG: Huerter
SF: Reddish
PF: Bobby Portis
C: Okongwu / Vet Min. Big

That team is deep, versatile, and well-rounded: a good mix for playoff basketball. Note also that Nate McMillan seems perfectly capable as a coach and should be the Hawks HC long-term, which is a plus.


3. The Hawks have the flexibility to trade for a disgruntled star next year, and that could truly make them special. Unlike most other teams contending for titles, the Hawks have good young players on cheap contracts for next year, and have all of their draft picks. 

If a star like Bradley Beal or Zach Lavine demands a trade, the Atlanta Hawks can outbid other teams in order to acquire them via trade. They could really sweeten the pot with multiple young players, numerous first round picks, and an established vet while still being a title contender worthy of a star player’s respect and time. 

That’s something that the Clippers and many other contenders can’t do, which makes them significantly less capable of improving their rosters substantially. This is what makes the Hawks uniquely good as a free agent landing spot. Adding a third star to Trae Young and Kawhi Leonard in 2022 would be entirely possible and would make the Hawks a true force in the NBA for years to come.

Does PG ask for a trade? I don’t think they can create cap space which rules out a big deal for Lowry or one of the bigger FA’s.

Controversial take: Joel Embiid is spectacular, a two way phenom, the reason the Sixers are good recently, and simply a player with an MVP type of ceiling. 

But with his injury history, are we sure the Sixers are making the right decision keeping him above Simmons?

Now no one could predict injuries, Embiid is still young, and a center of his caliber is literally impossible to find... 

But isn't that the point? Embiid would fetch a crazy high amount of picks and players if he was traded today, similar to the AD and Jrue Holiday and Paul George trades. Meanwhile, I imagine, Simmons wouldn't. 

So if you did trade Embiid -- who would you get back? Could you trade him for all of New York's assets and picks? or to Oklahoma for a good amount of their draft war chest? Would a team of Ben Simmons + high pick X + new young guy you traded for + Tyrese Maxey, who you assume wouldn't get traded + Tobias Harris eventually be better than what you could build around Embiid? Is Embiid so good that he's worth more risk? 

Meanwhile -- what do you get for Simmons exactly? Are you sure you're getting back a guy who helps you win now? Is that guy the short term answer for a finals appearance? And what if Simmons just improves immediately with a new team and coach?

But isn't that the point? Embiid would fetch a crazy high amount of picks and players if he was traded today, similar to the AD and Jrue Holiday and Paul George trades. Meanwhile, I imagine, Simmons wouldn't. 

So if you did trade Embiid -- who would you get back? Could you trade him for all of New York's assets and picks? or to Oklahoma for a good amount of their draft war chest? Would a team of Ben Simmons + high pick X + new young guy you traded for + Tyrese Maxey, who you assume wouldn't get traded + Tobias Harris eventually be better than what you could build around Embiid? Is Embiid so good that he's worth more risk? 

Meanwhile -- what do you get for Simmons exactly? Are you sure you're getting back a guy who helps you win now? Is that guy the short term answer for a finals appearance? And what if Simmons just improves immediately with a new team and coach?

So I'm just saying, maybe the Sixers should sell high on Embiid and do the quick retool around Simmons instead.","t3_o9p4iw","https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/o9p4iw/shouldnt_the_sixers_trade_embiid_instead_of/",0,9,"t1_h3cd7b5","2021-28-06 10:36:42 AM","No because the player would would hope to draft with those picks is Embiid. You don't ever trade an MVP caliber player in their prime unless forced to because the return you get back is going to less than they are worth. The chance that any asset or pick you get is going to be replaced Embiid's value is really low. Also if you're going to trade Embiid you might as well trade Simmons as well because the team isn't going to be winning much with Simmons as the lead man for the team. Might as well just restart the process if that's the case.",20,0.062,0.762,0.175,0.8958,6.75

For example, Atlanta has a nice young core captained by Trae Young that will be good for years in the East. Milwaukee has a good competitive future as long as Giannis is around. Phoenix and Denver have great futures out West. Teams like Memphis, Minnesota, and OKC could have really bright futures. 

The big 4 teams (Nets, Lakers, Clippers, Knicks) are the four that get most of the national media headlines. The Nets, Lakers, and Clippers are present-built contenders that are built around superstars but have pretty cloudy long term futures. The Knicks have a younger squad, but made a good impression and improvement this season which could make them a primary place for free agents. 

These are the teams that get the most buzz, yet aren’t really built for years to come.

What is the future of the Nets, as the big 3 come up for contracts in the next few years? Are the Knicks building something good or is it a mirage?

Look at Kevin Knox and Frank N, those draft selections could be other players who could be transformational for the Knicks. As the established team in the biggest market they should become a free agent destination but the biggest problem the Knicks (and other teams face) is less and less players move via free agency. Most of the high profile players have recently re-upped with their current teams. Now when superstars want to move they just demand a trade, it’s messy but they get what they want largely because agents and franchises are so interconnected to the detriment of the sport.  The Knicks could go all in on a trade and give up all their picks and swaps for a player like e.g Beal but then you’re giving up all your future assets.

The list is Giannis, Luka, Kawhi, Bron, AD, Dame, Steph, Harden, Joker, KD, Embiid.

I posted on this sub a couple of weeks ago about the potential of Booker becoming a BPCT and after Trae’s run that he is having, I have the same elusive question. I think it’s accepted that there are 11 guys that are BPCT worthy, where if you put them on a team with another BPCT guy + anselory pieces (ex. Bron and AD) or a second-best guy with great role players (ex. Kawhi and PG) or a second and third guy with meh to crap role players (ex. Giannis, Jrue, Middleton), these are all theoretical Larry O’Brien worthy teams.

There are a few guys that I think are on the fringe of this tier right now but have arguments of why they haven’t accomplished what they “should have”: Embiid, Giannis, Dame, Harden, and AD. 

The first thing I thought about in regard to Trae is what does he have to do to rise to this top tier? I think we have to start with what all these guys have in common (this all theoretical and arguable). 

&#x200B;

1. If you throw two BPCT guys together (barring injury) they have to make the finals.
2. They have to be able to average at least 25 in the playoffs and be at least a neutral on defense.
3. They have to beat another BPCT guy on their way to, or in the Finals. 
4. At any point in time you can make an argument they are the best player in the world.

There might be more or less qualifiers, but I think this is sufficient. 

I think if Trae beats the Bucks you can make the argument he has gone above and beyond, going against three incredible defensive teams and two BPCT’s. This is where the argument starts because if he doesn’t beat Giannis the argument can’t be made IMO. (Side Note: If Giannis loses with a theoretically far better team, he gets moved out of this tier for me). After that, I think he has to at the very least have a 2019 Paul George type MVP next year where he is solidly in the race. Finally, he has to get to at least the second round next year.

To sum it up IMO for Trae to become a BPCT he has to beat Giannis, has an MVP-like season next year, and Get to the second round next year.","t3_o7reez","https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/o7reez/is_trae_a_best_player_on_a_championship_team_guy/",17,35,"t1_h30xp5n","2021-25-06 11:52:19 AM","Trae has to be in that discussion. He at this point has proven to be offensively as good as all the other guys to build around. His main knock has been his defense, which team's have not yet found a way to exploit. It seems like as bad as he is on defense, as long as there is one weak link to hide him on, it's fine. The Knicks weren't able to exploit him, Philly wasn't able to exploit him. Bucks did not in game 1.  &#x200B; I do believe with Trae as your best player he will eventually run into matchup problems against a team that does have the personnel exploit him, or maybe run into a coach that can figure out how to target him more easily. But just because a team has occasional matchup problems does not mean they are not worth building around. I think one of the things that doesn't really get acknowledged is how hard it really is to win a championship. In a way we sort of got used to the Warriors Lebron era where the two best teams sort of dominated everyone else, but that's not the standard that any individual player should be held to in the discussion (it's a little different if we're having a GOAT discussion though). If you have Trae, and you properly build around him, every single year you have a legitimate shot at winning the title. Sometimes the bracket will go against you, sometimes you'll get the perfect matchups, some years will just be weak. Trae has what takes to get you there.",2,0.072,0.818,0.11,0.892,2.6

First love was football, first bball position was guard...both of these things changed with a huge growth spurt

Won conference DPotY, PotY, and RotY in his conference, the first to win all 3 since Anthony Davis.

##strengths:

* Smooth athlete who glides around the floor with terrific footwork, has some SF skills at 7 ft you see his guard background growing up
* crazy high ceiling due to [perimeter dribble drive game](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8kbRdd5lXD8&t=330s&ab_channel=HoopIntellect) (not featured at USC as much as HS) 
* good shooting tools (length allows him to shoot contested jumpers like he's unguarded), [good mechanics](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHIPNF1aeA&t=15s&ab_channel=MarchMadness) (guide hand, on balance, range)
* Mirrors on the perimeter [like a young Tristan Thompson](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8kbRdd5lXD8&t=133s&ab_channel=HoopIntellect), excellent hip fluidity, hedges and recovers on screens
* Rare rim protector, with the speed and handle to [grab and go full court](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tBusWYzs9o&t=146s&ab_channel=CollegeFilms)
* Good roll man in the PnR
* Not a playmaker, but good vision, he is not a blackhole ala Drummond


##challenges:

* Length masks limited explosion, but still a good enough vertical athlete to finish inside
* physicality/durability he's Slim Reaper thin, but is still really young
* needs to prove he can stretch the floor as a modern 4, was asked to play more traditionally at USC (only 40 3pt attempts)
* has to balance being a team player with being assertive, doesn't 'take over', plays his game and takes his shots but doesn't force

##improvements to become a star:

* take advantage of NBA spacing and driving lanes it will provide
* consistency in shooting (again only 40 3's at USC there is some projection to his outside-in game)
* carry defensive versatility into the nba (ability to switch on to guards on the perimeter and rim protect inside)

Here are what I consider the top 10 playoff games in his career. I'm taking into account the production (statistics and performance), the importance (elimination game, closeout game) the stage ( Finals, WCF, WCSF) and the context. Although Kobe doesn't have as many iconic epic playoff performances like Jordan, Lebron, Magic etc, he still came through when it mattered most.

10. 2009 WCSF Game 4 vs Utah Jazz. 38 points, 1 assist, 6 rebounds, 16/24 FG. Coming off one of his worst playoff games shooting an anemic 5/24 in game 3, Kobe responded in Game 4 with a barrage of tough midrange jumpers claiming a commanding 3-1 lead.

9. 2009 Finals, Game 1 vs Orlando Magic. 40 points, 8 assists, 8 rebounds. 16/34 FG. Coming into this finals, people still doubted whether Kobe could lead his team to a championship without Shaq. So Kobe put up his one and only 40 point final game.

8. 2008 WCSF, Game 5 vs San Antonio Spurs. 39 points, 3 assists, 3 rebounds, 16/30 FG. One of his most underrated series, Kobe had to face a prime defending champion San Antonio Spurs. He closed the Spurs out in game 5 with this performance which included 17 in the 4th.

7. 2001 WCSF, Game 4 vs Sacramento Kings. 48 points, 3 assists, 16 rebounds, 15/29 FG, 17/19 FT. 22 year old Kobe put the Kings away with an epic performance including 15 points in the 4th when they came into the 4th down 4.

6. 2002 Finals, Game 3 vs New Jersey. 36 points, 4 assists, 6 rebounds, 14/23 FG. Lakers came into game 3 up 2-0, winning game 3 meant winning the series. Kobe had his best game of the finals and hit a clutch dagger jump shot to put the Lakers up 4 with 20 seconds remaining sealing the finals victory.

5. 2008 WCFR, Game 2 vs Denver Nuggets. 49 points, 10 assists, 4 rebounds, 18/27 FG. In terms of pure production this is no doubt Kobe's most dominant playoff game.

4. 2010 WCF, Game 6 vs Phoenix Suns. 37 points, 2 assists, 6 rebounds, 12/25 FG. Game 6 closeout game for the Lakers. Kobe scored 11 in the 4th including 2 incredibly tough fadeaway jumpers in the face of Grant Hill in the final minute with the iconic slap on coach Alvin Gentry's butt, securing their spot in the finals.

3. 2006 WCFR, Game 6 vs Phoenix Suns. 50 points, 5 assists, 8 rebounds, 20/35 FG. Easily would be his greatest playoff performance had they won but unfortunately they lost through no fault of Kobe's. He put up a Herculean performance but the undertalented Lakers lost.

2. 2004 WCSF, Game 4 vs San Antonio Spurs. 42 points, 5 assists, 6 rebounds, 15/27 FG. Heading into Game 3, the Lakers were down 2-0 vs the spurs. After winning Game 3, the Lakers NEEDED to win Game 4 as going down 3-1 most likely would spell doom for the Lakers. Kobe put up 42 points, the momentum shifted the entire series and the Lakers would win the next 2 and beat the Spurs.

1. 2000 Finals, Game 4 vs Indiana Pacers. 28 points, 5 assists, 4 rebounds, 14/27 FG. I bet most people are wondering why this fairly mediocre performance is what I consider his greatest playoff performance. This is because of the context behind this game. Lakers came into this game up 2-1 in a pivotal Game 4, meaning if the Lakers won this game, they most likely would win the series. The game went into overtime in which Shaq had fouled out whilst the game was still tight. Kobe proceeded to score 8 points in the final 2 minutes including a putback dagger with 5 seconds remaining that iced the game, sealing the win. Considering the importance of this game and the stage along with the fact that he was only 20 years old, I believe this to be his best playoff game.","t3_ofimpa","https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/ofimpa/kobe_bryant_top_10_playoff_games/",16,11,"t1_h4cncgd","2021-07-07 6:23:41 AM","[removed]",-1,0,1,0,0,1.5

"nbadiscussion","lukadirkfan","Realistic Ben Simmons trade possibilities","2021-21-06 11:01:07 AM","I've seen a lot of talk about trading Simmons, for obvious reasons, but most of it is just memes or dreams, so I wanted to actually take a look around and see if there are any real possibilities out there.

The first and most obvious that people are talking about is Ben for CJ McCollum.  While on it's face this looks like a win win for both teams, I doubt that Morey will see that as equal value.  I don't believe CJ is good enough to be the perimeter creator that they need to put them over the top, and I can see Portland being hesitant to send more assets back, when Simmons' value, despite being an all-star and all-defense player, is at an all time low.  Many people have also been speculating about a Lillard trade, but despite his recent tweets, nothing he has done has indicated that he wants to leave Portland, and the only way they trade him is if he pulls a Harden, which I don't think is in his character.

The next most obvious trade partner would probably be OKC, who's recent MO has been to take on these types of projects.  If I'm Morey, I'm seeing if I can get a deal done for SGA.  This would mean attaching picks to Simmons, but to me I see much more potential for SGA to be a top level perimeter creator than CJ.  From the OKC side, I can't see SGA as being untouchable when they have no clear picture of what their roster is going to look like even next year, and Simmons is only two years older.  The money isn't even close, but if I'm not mistaken the Thunder have 60m+ in space so they should just be able to absorb him into space.  Morey and Presti also have a very good working relationship, which certainly doesn't hurt.

Another obvious target would be Beal, for whom you'd have to send a king's ransom ala the packages for Harden, AD etc.  This, to me, is the highest guaranteed return though of the three trades, so I believe you have to pursue it.  One might say that the Wizards would never agree to pair up Russ and Simmons, but if they are trading Beal they are committing to a full rebuild until Russ's contract is up regardless, so being bad in the meantime would be beneficial.  If they can talk themselves into Ben developing more of an offensive game once he gets out of Philly, I could see them willing to do the deal for the right price.  I think the fit of Beal and Embiid would be basically perfect, game and personality wise, so I'd definitely be willing to go all in on it.  Are three or four firsts plus Simmons enough to get it done?  I'd throw in Maxey as well if I was Morey.

Finally, I would look at Zach Lavine.  Although he's basically a poor man's Beal, he is, again, at least a tier above CJ in my opinion and has shown continued improvement.  Chicago is reeling after going all in at the trade deadline and failing to make the playoffs, so they might be willing to entertain the possibility of a Simmons Lavine swap, especially if it recoups some of their draft stock.  On paper Simmons would mesh well with Vucevic, who is more of a stretch big than Embiid, would obviously do a lot for them on defense, and with Koby White on the roster would not have to shoulder all of the perimeter creation duties.  Again, you would have to attach picks, and this might be a sticking point if Chicago expect a Beal-esque package, but if they can convince themselves that they can rehabilitate Simmons, there might be a deal to be done.

After the comments from Embiid and Rivers, I think it's a foregone conclusion that Simmons is not on the Sixers roster at the start of next season, and it's going to be very interesting to see how it all plays out.","t3_o519sv","https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/o519sv/realistic_ben_simmons_trade_possibilities/",0,34,"t1_h2kb7ly","2021-21-06 11:21:57 AM","It really depends on the interest in Simmons from other teams. Despite his embarrassing look last night, I have to imagine a lot of teams being interested in him on a trade block. Let’s look at who would enjoy him as a fit: Lowry/Simmons swap between Toronto and Philly. This deal was discussed at the deadline and has been talked about before. Lowry is the point guard Philly needs and he’s a hometown kid. Toronto would be a nice Simmons landing spot for a Raptors team that struggled defensively this season. I figure Nurse could fit him nicely around FVV, Siakam, GTJ, and OG as well. It would be an interesting group to watch.  Kemba/Simmons swap between Philly and OKC. A good veteran point guard for Philly, and OKC gets a young All Star to fit next to SGA and their future. OKC takes on bad contracts all the time and usually rehabs players pretty well. This would be a good basketball fit for him to lessen distractions and a good culture for him to grow in.  A McCollum/Simmons swap between Portland and Philly has been widely rumored and discussed. It helps Portland defensively and helps Philly offensively.  Brogdon/Simmons swap between Philly and Indiana. Indy would be another good small market organization that allows Ben to grow and develop his game, depending on who they get as coach. With a player like Sabonis, it would be an interesting fit. Brogdon gives Philly a guard that can score and has some defensive game as well.  Simmons/Porzingis could be seen as a lateral move for both teams, but Dallas desperately needs defenders next to Luka. Porzingis and Embiid would be a tough frontcourt to defend and would be a nice twin towers type of thing. Their contracts could be moved for each other.  Simmons & Thybulle for AG & Barton between Philly and Denver. Gordon-Simmons could be seen as lateral, but the inclusion of Barton makes it worthy to me for Philly. Denver has a thing for tall, long, athletic skilled guys. Simmons would be a fun fit next to Jokic’s skill and next to scorers like Murray and MPJ.",9,0.051,0.783,0.166,0.987,4.16
"nbadiscussion","RecordReviewer","Which stats would be most interesting to track that don't have a lot of historical tracking?","2021-09-07 11:41:03 AM","A lot of the problem with judging player ability and judging player defense in particular is that no one can watch all or most NBA games and even in the games watched, it's very hard to pay attention to every player most of the time. This is especially true for judging older players as limited game footage is available to most people. Here are some stats I would like to see tracked for historical games if the NBA ever gets around to doing tracking stats for old games.

&#x200B;

1. Defensive glass win-rate : How frequently does the player hold proper position against the guy they're boxing out? Could adjust for players that are better at offensive rebounding.
2. Offensive glass win-rate: How frequently does the player beat his defender to get to position for an offensive rebound? 
3. Offensive glass win-rate against double box-outs: Double box-outs (where two players box out one guy) are very common in small-ball lineups. This would be a rarer stat to track than others, but still interesting.
4. Time to get back on defense relative to other players on each possession: This is not only interesting to track because it's relevant to defensive ability, but it could encourage players to spend less time falling over flopping or complaining instead of getting back on defense.
5. Closeout speed on shooters: Super important for modern basketball, would need to take into account shooter quality and how good they are at driving.
6. Success rate at containing penetration in isolation: Often, a player getting beaten off the dribble doesn't lead to their opponent scoring, but instead, their teammate helps and the ball handler kicks it out for an open three or dumps it off for a dunk. Tracking how well penetration was contained also seems valuable.
7. Distance given to player while off-ball and on-ball: A measure of gravity that is important
8. On-ball pick-and-roll success denial: How frequently the defender of a pick-and-roll can avoid a switch on the pick-and-roll without surrendering penetration or space to the ball handler or the roll man.

&#x200B;

Would anyone watch basketball played NFL style, with Defensive / Offensive teams?

  
Kinda like half court playground games. take a free throw to determine who gets first possession. No winners or losers out. Each team gets 3 minutes to score however much they can. Team A's offensive 5 versus Team B's defensive 5. Then give the ball to the other team, their turn. Take a break after 12 minutes. 

Keep taking turns, keep adding the scores, similar to how they do it currently for the All Star Game, for each quarter scores. It might lead to impossibly large margins, like this year's All Star, but that's where the defense would really have to put their stamp on the game, to ensure the scores don't become too much for their offensive team to overcome. 

Would this allow specialists or extreme GOATs to really shine? Like, how much would Steph and co. be able to pour in the 3s on a quintet focused only on stopping him? Or, how much would a team of Ben Simmons type players cause havoc on an offense? Or would a really good Offensive / Defensive Coach be able to finally show his true value?

Players wouldn't get played off the court as they could simply focus on their primary strengths - offense or defense. We have situational subs now anyway, but in this case we'd have a longer time to be in that situation.

Offense vs Defense","2021-08-07 6:57:14 AM","This [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/ofqosc/is_the_nba_making_a_mistake_marketing_players/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) got me thinking... Would anyone watch basketball played NFL style, with Defensive / Offensive teams?

  
Kinda like half court playground games. take a free throw to determine who gets first possession. No winners or losers out. Each team gets 3 minutes to score however much they can. Team A's offensive 5 versus Team B's defensive 5. Then give the ball to the other team, their turn. Take a break after 12 minutes. 

Keep taking turns, keep adding the scores, similar to how they do it currently for the All Star Game, for each quarter scores. It might lead to impossibly large margins, like this year's All Star, but that's where the defense would really have to put their stamp on the game, to ensure the scores don't become too much for their offensive team to overcome. 

Would this allow specialists or extreme GOATs to really shine? Like, how much would Steph and co. be able to pour in the 3s on a quintet focused only on stopping him? Or, how much would a team of Ben Simmons type players cause havoc on an offense? Or would a really good Offensive / Defensive Coach be able to finally show his true value?

Players wouldn't get played off the court as they could simply focus on their primary strengths - offense or defense. We have situational subs now anyway, but in this case we'd have a longer time to be in that situation.

What do you guys think?","t3_og7q3i","https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/og7q3i/nfl_style_offense_vs_defense/",4,4,"t1_h4h7mw0","2021-08-07 7:37:50 AM","The biggest challenge with this system is the volume of stoppages in a game. People love basketball partially because of the pace of the game and with a formula closer to the NFL, you would lose that. I know many basketball fans that don't like football and or baseball because the game is too slow with all the pauses in the action. Also playing halfcourt takes away the athleticism and fast-break component of the game which helps makes basketball so exciting.  In this set up you would lose this entirely.   I also respect players that can be effective and great on both offense and defense. If you want to score at will on me at one end, try and stop me on the other end when I do the same to you. I want to see the same guys go at each other on both ends of the court. I would not watch it personally as it removes too much about what I like about the game.",17,0.063,0.768,0.169,0.9551,6.69

And mostly “it’s not even close” type opinions - but going both ways.  

Obviously Paul has the opportunity to win a title in the coming weeks which would likely skew the results in his favor (if he wins), so I think it’s appropriate to ask this question now: who has had a better career so far?

**Similarities**

   - Both are in the latter half of their career, 

   - Both are playing in the same era (not usually the case in these comparisons,

   - Both are (arguably) considered top-3 (or at least top-5) at their position all time, 

   - They’ve each racked up significant regular season awards/honors, though despite this, most people would agree that the postseason play for each is fairly consistently underwhelming.

Oscar himself wasn't much of a defensive threat either but there's only so much a point guard can do to impact team defense. Reading and watching this [analysis](https://backpicks.com/2017/12/21/backpicks-goat-12-oscar-robertson/) from Ben Taylor, Oscar's defense was fairly neutral and average for a point guard. And even if it was below average it didn’t matter much because his offense was so ridiculously efficient and productive for his era. But unfortunately the Royal's overall team defense was horrid throughout his entire tenure save for one season.

Since then I found out Bob Harrison was Native (*he's most notable for being the Lakers' SG from '50-54 and hitting a half-court buzzer beater in the 1950 Finals*), and I just heard about the other two, both of whom had rather short pro careers. All 4 of the players listed in the post title played long before the other 4 who are all relatively ""recent"" (*Dele, Parks, Baker, Irving*), so I'll say a little about each. There may be others, but these are the only 8 I'm aware of right now. BTW, major gratitude goes to u/TringlePringle for his assistance with this info.

**Bob Harrison:** With that dominant Laker dynasty in the early days, the front court was super legendary since they had the best C, PF, and SF in the league (*George Mikan, Vern Mikkelsen, Jim Pollard*), and their PG was also a HOF-er (*Slater Martin*). They rotated through a few SG's, but the primary one during their run of titles was Harrison ([career stats](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/h/harribo02.html)). He was a 1x All-Star and a 3x champion, but he's most famous for hitting a [half-court bomb of a buzzer beater](https://youtu.be/X9feuTd3XJk) to win Game 1 of the 1950 Finals. [Here](https://harrisonhis.wordpress.com/2011/11/24/harrisons-heritage-an-nba-rarity/) is an article about his Native heritage (*I believe he was Hočąk*), including this info about how open his heritage was during his playing days *""While with the Lakers, Harrison served as president of the Minnesota-based North American Indian Society in 1951-52. Also during his time in Minneapolis, on a night when Harrison was honored by his team, a number of local tribes presented him with a deerskin jacket.""*

**Phil Jordon:** I wrote a good bit about Jordon last year, which you can check out [here](https://old.reddit.com/r/VintageNBA/comments/hldl5z/phil_jordon_the_1st_native_american_player_in_nba/). Basically he was a decent-not-great center around 1960, and his biggest claim to fame was that he did NOT play in the game where Wilt scored 100 points. Jordon was the Knicks' starting center in '62 --and their only starter taller than 6-ft-6-- but he drank an entire case of beer the night before the game and sat out ""sick"", so the already awful Knicks who had a horrible front court had no chance against the Warriors and Wilt who had a historic day of stat hoarding. 

**Gary Gray:** Gray was part of the Delaware Nation while growing up in Oklahoma. He played sparingly for the Royals during the '68 season ([career stats](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/g/grayga01.html)), was then selected by the Bucks in the 1968 Expansion Draft, but he never played beyond that 1 season in Cincinnati. 

**Sonny Dove:** Dove's mother was Mashpee Wampanoag and after he had a fantastic college career at St. John's, he was the #4 pick in the 1967 draft by the Pistons (*1 pick before Walt Frazier*). He played sparingly with Detroit for 2 years, then he went to the ABA's Nets for 3 seasons ('70-72), averaging 14 ppg and 8 rpg during his first 2 seasons in NY ([career stats](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/d/doveso01.html)). His career ended early due to a bicycle accident, and he went on to earn his degree and announce St. John's games until his death in 1983.","t3_odrc4y","https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/odrc4y/4_native_players_who_played_in_the_50s_and_60s/",43,2,"t1_h4da1ku","2021-07-07 9:19:09 AM","I just want to say I really appreciate this post - nothing to add, but I really enjoyed reading it. asdfadsfasdfasdfasdfadsfasdfasdfadfadfadsfasdfadsfasdfasdfadsfadsfasdfasdfasdfasdfasdfasdfasdfasdfasdfasdfasdf",2,0,0.635,0.365,0.7927,5.15

In 1954-55 and 1955-56, Chuck Share started at center for the Hawks, so Pettit was PF. In 1956-57, they brought in Ed Macauley but still had Share there, so a common starting lineup involved Pettit at SF, Macauley at PF, and Share at center, although Auerbach always defended him with Russell regardless. In 1957-58, Hagan burst onto the scene and the Hawks frontcourt became Hagan at SF, Pettit at PF, and Macauley at C. In 1958-59, Macauley began to severely slow down and Share returned to the starting center spot, but Hagan remained at SF and Pettit at PF. The next season, Lovellette went from sixth man to starting center and Share was benched and eventually traded away. That made the lineup Hagan at SF, Pettit at PF, and Lovellette at center, which remained the Hawks' starting frontcourt from 1959-60 to 1961-62. Lovellette was sold to Boston in the summer of 1962, but they drafted Zelmo Beaty, who started at center for St. Louis for the rest of Pettit's career. There's only a single year where he wasn't primarily a PF, and that was a weird circumstance where he was pushed out of position because the coach wanted to try a Twin Towers duo but obviously couldn't bench Pettit.",1,0.032,0.906,0.062,0.7272,2.12

"nbadiscussion","Camctrail","8 observations from this post-season.","2021-24-06 11:23:22 AM","1. Big Ball vs Small Ball centers
   1. One of things that was interesting was how in 2020, it was a season of small ball centers taking center stage. Bam Adebayo helped sink the Celtics. Anthony Davis was a defensive force. The Rockets bet the farm on PJ Tucker. All these dudes, outside Davis, were legit small for the center, while Davis is skinny. All of them had some level of success.
   2. In 2021 though, arguably what we're seeing is the rise of Big ball centers -- guys with some offensive skills but whose role is really to play D and PLAY BIG. Three of the four teams left count on guys who are Big Ball centers -- Ayton, whose a mobile 7 footer and the talk of the playoffs, Lopez, a sweet shooting big man who can box out and defend well, and Clint Capela, whose as close to a poor man's clone of Dwight Howard as any in the league. This is a big difference than from last year. I'm defining the big ball center by what they do on D not O, btw. 
2. Superstar/Hybrid Centers have done well this playoffs, but if you ask them to do too much on offense, you didn't get out of the second round
   1. The common thread of KD, Embiid and Jokic. KD saw his teammates go down and him step up to play big and score, setting up the offense. He did amazing. It wasn't enough, eliminated. Embiid had to also be the last line of defense, play big and set up his offense. It was too much, eliminated. Jokic saw his teammates go down, play big and set up his offense. MVP of the regular season, but that's too much, eliminated. If you compare this to Giannis, whose job was to play D reasonably well while also leading the offense, but not be the entirety of the defense at the rim and doing defensive rebounding, you see why he's still standing. It's going to be a while before we see a Shaq in 2000 performance ever again, something that should make us appreciate that ALOT more. 
3. Rudy Gobert took the heat for Utah losing, but the reality is is that injuries caught up to the team's guards. 
   1. We all just like to make fun of him and it's okay, he should gain a thicker skin. This one's been done ad nauseam. Just remember -- to lose a 26 point lead, both your defense and offense must fail, and considering Reggie Jackson and Terrance Mann suddenly went super saiyan, from all over the court, while Don Mitchell just couldn't score anymore, I put that lost squarely on the guards of the team, and then on Rudy. Wouldn't be shocked if their injuries are worse than we think.
4. The Suns are a young team but play like an old team, they don't turn the ball over that much and that will likely be a big reason they beat the Clippers, if they beat the Clippers.
   1. When I predicted the Lakers to go over the Suns in the first round, I was relying on old logic -- young teams don't win, even in wacky seasons. Well, that's because young teams have a tendency to self combust, turning the ball over under pressure, not knowing who should shoot on the last play, having some chemistry issues, etc. That and the Lakers thrived off teams turning the ball over last season, turning Russell Westbrook's dribbling into a liability, something that led to transition and then AD putting the other team in foul trouble. Well... I was wrong! The Suns have legit none of those issues of young teams and are pretty careful with the basketball! One wonders if this due to CP3 being a basketball wizard and changing his approach with age and playing on that OKC team last season. I genuinely believe this is the net effect of CP3, he's one of those beyond the box score leader types. 
5. Injuries had a big effect, but so do role players stepping up.
   1. People will write about this 1000x here so I'm not going to add anything. Have at it.
6. Ben Simmons scraped by on potential and now that's simply not good enough.
   1. 10 years ago, Ben Simmons would've played like Rajon Rondo, and would have been expected to have similar levels of success to Rondo. This legit wasn't that long ago, Rondo was phenomenal for a while and the league isn't fully in ""everyone must shoot"" mode until the Warriors first chip, though teams were experimenting. We still have players that are relics of that era, though increasingly, they're less effective. 
   2. As his season is now over, it's time to assess Ben Simmons and the role of ""non shooting, defense first point guards."" One surmises that a point guard who can't shoot, can't effectively do his job despite being 6'10, because the defense sags back in the playoffs. This isn't so much an issue if you're going to be running at the basket all the time in transition. The thing with playoff ball is that, transition opportunities get limited by teams suddenly playing much more carefully with the ball.
   3. This then begs the question, are we simply miscasting Ben Simmons as a point guard now? Is he ACTUALLY a point guard or is he... a point forward or small ball 5? I think this is the major question surrounding Simmons, which is A) what is he and B) how much should he be enabled by teams (the Westbrook question). It doesn't take a genius to see he's probably needing a rethinking of what he can do by someone. 
7. Trae Young, Kawhi Leonard, Luka Doncic, Kevin Durant, Donovan Mitchell, Devin Booker are keeping Kobe's memory alive even better than the 2020 Lakers did, by shooting from the midrange so effectively. 
   1. Arguably, this should be the least shocking thing about the playoffs -- when the clock ticks down and the balls in the superstars hands, their job is to make silly, ridiculous shots, like Kobe did, like Wade did, like Jordan did, etc. The midrange is the superstars shot, it's the shot they get paid for, and I just listed 6 guys who having that midrange in the game is probably lifting them past their peers. 
8. The Hawks vs Bucks is a major question of winning in the NBA -- is defense or offense more important? 
   1. The Hawks are a better offensive team that is an okay defensive team. Capela helps. But you know, their best defense is shooting and making shots, kinda like the old Rockets were.
   2. The Bucks are a staunch SLOW IT DOWN AND TRY TO SCORE ON US defensive team, with some shooters to keep the game close if the other team is scoring a lot or make the game get out of hand if the opponent can't score at all. They have four good defenders in the starting lineup, and in a way, somewhat resemble the 2020 Lakers, only Middleton is in the AD free safety role.
   3. I don't know who would win, my prediction even after game 1 is this is a knockdown dragout series, but there's legit two philosophies on the floor, and if the Bucks win it would match my perception that BAD ASS D wins titles. But they also could not win. I don't know. 
9. The teams left standing all have a combination of young guys and veterans, affirming what I, a know nothing fan, have always believed in was the championship formula.
   1. Whether its the Hawks with Gallinari, Bucks with Jrue, Clippers with Reggie Jackson, or the Suns with CP3, the impact of guys with 10 plus year careers in the league can often be felt in that even if they're bad, they provide some steadiness in the playoffs. Arguably these guys have bigger roles than they had, getting their big contracts, outside Reggie Jackson. Always important to note is whose got a team built like this, IMO.","t3_o76t0q","https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/o76t0q/8_observations_from_this_postseason/",7,4,"t1_h2xg85f","2021-24-06 2:01:05 PM","It's not necessarily big boy centers who are making a comeback, it's big boy centers who can ALSO hang with perimeter players on defense.

"nbadiscussion","kevinwangg","A comparison of FTA per 36 in the Regular Season vs. Post Season 2015 - 2021","2021-01-07 9:22:03 AM","The NBA announced that it would be changing the rules to help curb some of the unnatural motion that players use to game the rules and draw fouls.  The announcement specifically called out Trae Young and James Harden, but this could also be applied to many other foul baiters, like Joel Embiid, Chris Paul, and Kevin Durant.  During the post season, it is not uncommon to see these master baiters complain to the refs after not getting a call that they may have gotten dozens of times in the regular season or earlier rounds of the playoffs.  Are these players actually getting fewer fouls called for them in the post season compared to the regular season?

I wanted to determine if the players are actually getting fewer fouls in the post season.  Using Basketball Reference player statistics for the regular season and post season dating back to 2015, I tried to accomplish just that.  To take out any bias that might be created by small sample sizes, I removed any player-season, where the player played fewer than 500 regular season minutes and fewer than 80 post season minutes.  I then calculated the number of FTA per 36 minutes in the regular season and the post season for each player-year.  I then created a scatter plot with the X-axis as regular season FTA per 36 and Y-axis of post season FTA per 36.  If players were getting fouled at the same rate in the regular season as the post season, a linear regression would have a slope of 1, so I added this ideal line to the chart in black.  I also added the actual linear regression line to the chart, which can be seen below in blue:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/mt7s5l2efm871.png?width=561&format=png&auto=webp&s=830325af553aa1fa5bf2b8ec534417fff4474301

The linear regression model has slope of 0.91 and an intercept of 0.23, which indicates that a theoretical player who draws zero fouls per 36 in the regular season would draw .23 fouls per 36 in the post season.  On the flip side, a player that leads the league in fouls drawn in the regular season would have the biggest drop in FTA in the playoffs.  This can be seen by how the blue linear regression line clearly starts to deviate away from the ideal line at around 5 FTA per 36.  It appears as if players that draw few fouls in the regular season are being rewarded with additional FTA in the post season and players that drew more fouls in the regular season are being punished with fewer FTA in the playoffs.  

This effect is likely the result of a combination of factors: defenders learning more of the offensive players foul baiting tricks over the course of a 7 game series and refs changing how they ref in the post season, and ""letting the players play.""  It begs to the question if refs should ref the same way in the regular season and post season?

Some fun statistical nuggets from this analysis:

* In 2017 Dewayne Dedmon shot nearly 12 FTs per 36 in the playoffs after shooting 2.5 in the regular season.  He made just over half of them.
* In 2020 Joel Embiid shot the highest number of FTs per 36 in the last 6 seasons, 14.6 because the Boston Celtics tried to defend him Daniel Theis and Enes Kanter.  The Celtics still swept the series.
* Of the top 10 highest FTA per 36 in the regular season, Giannis in 2021 has the worst ratio of post season to regular season free throw attempts.  10.4 FTA/36 in the regular season compared to 7.8 FTA/36 in the post season.","t3_obpavr","https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/obpavr/a_comparison_of_fta_per_36_in_the_regular_season/",18,6,"t1_h3qi9dk","2021-01-07 3:20:42 PM","What are all those 0s on the x-axis?

"nbadiscussion","NextMention10","Really sick of casuals claiming that the Phoenix Suns' finals run is fluky and a ""Mickey mouse finals""","2021-01-07 5:56:50 AM","it's not their fault that the teams they faced are injured. Phoenix just so happens to have one of the best medical teams in the NBA, which is evident in how Steve Nash evolved and stayed elite at a later age in his career. Furthermore, CP3 has since started an all-vegan diet similar to tom brady's which could improve his endurance and health. Overall, the phoenix suns took advantage of being young, healthy and having one of the best medical teams in order to suceed in this weird NBA season. Some may also say that the games are being rigged but they still had to make their shots and they still had to maintain their health. Availability is the best ability. If you say it's rigged then you're a casual who rides on the opinion of others. I'm not even a suns fan but we have to appreciate their run.

This run is special despite the presumed asterisks, this suns team still lacked the playoff experience going into the playoffs as only Jae Crowder and Chris Paul had significant playoff experience who also played major minutes. They still had to beat the LA Lakers with LeBron James, who is still a top tier talent at his age, the Denver Nuggets, even without Jamal Murray; still had the league MVP in Nikola Jokic and a bunch of capable role players. Could have easily been a 7 game series, but the suns still swept them despite CP3's lingering shoulder injury. They also beat the Clippers, despite not having kawhi leonard still had Paul George and capable role players with tremendous amounts of playoff experience and the coach who some analysts consider ""The Bill Belichik"" of the NBA with his ability to adjust game to game and mid game, having to come back 0-2 on two separate series shows this teams resilience and still they couldn't beat a CP3-less pheonix suns for the first 2 games of the series, and got smoked on Game 6 which lead to DMC and Pat Bev to show their true colors as sore losers. Yes, you may say that I pulled specific situations which benefit the Suns and you may consider it irrelevant but consider this; they persevered and made the NBA Finals.

Why? Because they took advantage of the situation.
They knew they lacked playoff experience going in, they knew they didn't have the talent to matchup to their opponents when they were healthy but they knew the situation. They knew that older teams with plenty of miles might have problems with injuries and took advantage of being young, having one of the best medical staffs in the NBA, their health and the leadership of CP3.
A similar sentiment is seen on the opposite coast wherein the young atlanta hawks and milwaukee bucks are 2 wins each away from the NBA Finals due mostly to the fact that they've been able to endure the physical toll of the NBA Season more than most teams.

Phoenix has no control over their opposition's health. The only responsibility Phoenix has, is to show up and play whatever team that fields 5 players on the court.  Has Phoenix benefited from their competition's injuries? Yes. But you can go year by year and break down where pretty much any team that has reached the finals, has benefited from injuries to other teams. 2020: Heat play a Bucks team with a Giannis that has repeatedly rolled his ankle in the playoffs. Lakers play the Heat in the finals with Dragic missing 5/6 games. Bam missed 2 games in the finals and was battling a shoulder injury.  2019: KD missing 5/6 games in the finals against the Raptors. Barely plays a few minutes in game 5 and tears his Achilles. Looney breaks his collarbone. Klay tears his ACL in game 6. Boogie was clearly hobbled the entire season. On the Raptors side, they were also missing OG the entire playoffs.  2018: Rockets up 3-2 on the Warriors and CP3 pulls a hamstring. Warriors win the series and go on to win the finals.  2017: Kawhi Leonard ankle injury in game 1 of the WC finals. Warriors go on to sweep the Spurs and win the championship.  2016: Andrew Bogut knee injury in game 5. Warriors lose their best rim protector and screen setter. Also, the Cavaliers got Draymond suspended for a game (although not an injury). 2015: Kyrie and Kevin Love injuries. LeBron was doing a solo job vs the Warriors and the Warriors ended up winning in 6 games. This is just off the top of my head, and I am sure you can go year by year and even name way more injuries than I just did. This year there has definitely been more injuries than normal, but it is part of the game and will always be.

"nbadiscussion","SaffronCityMayor","Silver Lining to Injuries: The Bull Market (Redemption?) Playoffs","2021-30-06 6:52:28 PM","We're all annoyed that we haven't gotten to see teams compete at full strength. But, we're dealt the hand we're dealt. It got me wondering about the best things that have come from this playoffs so far. And one thing that I've found striking is how many players have substantially raised their value/improved their reputation. The injuries opened up space for players to spread their wings, and it dropped expectations for most squads so that we can see what happens without lamenting what should have happened (there are a few glaring exceptions, and I'll note them). Here's a ~~quick~~ long-winded summary of some of the highlights:

* **Trae Young:** Went from a top 25ish player in people's rankings who might be a good stats on a bad team player to an unquestioned super star. His play was punctuated with a tough-as-nails, heel/ham persona.
* **Deandre Ayton:** Went from a solid young center that we hoped could make a few contributions in the playoffs to an efficient monster. There's still more to see how he sustains this play, but his ceiling was raised considerably.
* **Paul George:** There's a lot of straw manning about how the haters and fans felt, but let's be honest. Paul George was unquestionably an amazing talent who had not performed up to superstar expectations at a consistent enough level. He has absolutely been a superstar this postseason.
* **Chris Paul:** Dude hasn't had the playoff success that a pantheon point guard ought to have. He may or may not be the best player on his team, but the Suns are a team with his stamp on them, and they are clearly better for their resemblance to CP3.
* **Kevin Durant:** He definitely wanted the ring this year, and so it's a disappointment. But somehow I don't think it could've worked out better for him from a PR perspective. With Kyrie and Harden injured, KD got to put on some of the best basketball games we've ever seen anyone play. And afterward to go tell Giannis to get him one just felt right. Dude loves to hoop, and he has maybe settled into his skin enough to let that be his defining characteristic, rather than pursuing acceptance on social media.
* **Nicola Jokic**: I don't think his value changed in most people's minds, but he shored up his MVP claims by delivering in the first round and no one blames him for the Nuggets being outmatched without their number 2.
* **Seth Curry**: Seth is definitely the lowest rated player on this list so far, but his scoring for the Sixers when it was desperately needed by the Simmons void (more on that below) might have bumped him up a tier.
* **Reggie Jackson:** This guy was basically out of the league and now he's the best isolation player in basketball. Dude is unstoppable. It doesn't make sense to me, but I'm enjoying the show.
* **Role Players**: Without many of the #1 and #2 players, it's not just the new player that steps into that 'leader' spot, but the other 6th+ man who get to step up and shine as a starter. In this category, we have Terance Mann, Kevin Huerter, Boban!, Cam Payne, and others (let me know who I should be calling out here!).

Some folks have had good postseason but I feel like some negative storylines have kept their stock lower than it should be, but I still count them as net positives.

* **Giannis Antetokounmpo:** Yes, the Bucks almost lost to a depleted Nets squad and Giannis takes 45 seconds to miss a free throw. But the Shaq comparisons are becoming more and more apt: he puts up dominant numbers and can overwhelm opponents with his size and athleticism. Maybe he needs a ""Kobe/Wade"" closer to make some shots late, but Giannis absolutely can be the best player on a championship team.
* **Luka Doncic**: His stock was already high, and it would've soared even more if the Mavs closed out the Clippers. But, they didn't, his franchise is lurching around him, and both Trae and Ayton are still in the playoffs. That said, Luka's first round performance was so good, even while injured, that it feels like he took the next step in his career arc that has an all-time pantheon ceiling.
* **Dame Lillard**: That 55 point performance that had the entire NBA world watching and tweeting was a masterpiece. Moments like that is why I watch basketball. It's a disappointing season for the Blazers, and the current rumors of Dame \*maybe\* being unhappy further cloud things. On the whole, though, I'll remember Lillard's good more than the Blazers' bad this year.

It wouldn't be fair to argue that it's been a mostly positive-storyline (sans injuries) postseason without sharing what I think are the negative stories. I think these are pretty obvious, but I hope you'll see that there are really far fewer of these than positive ones:

* **Ben Simmons:** From All Star who should be a superstar to a 76ers PR project to improve his trade value. I think he'll be fine in time, but it's rough.
* **Rudy Gobert:** The one seed for Utah could've allowed Rudy to shake the reputation of being a great 'regular season' defender who can't get it done in the playoffs. I don't think he was as bad as some have said this postseason--he got put in impossible situations guarding the weak corner when the other subpar defenders on the Jazz got blown by. That said, it's hard to call this postseason a positive one for Rudy.
* **Dennis Schroder:** The Lakers mostly get a pass for losing to the Suns because of AD. Schroder was was so bad that he can't hide behind that injury.
* **Anthony Davis:** Of the injured players, AD gets the most flak. He's got a reputation for being injured too often, and this postseason doesn't instill confidence in Lakers fans going forward. His stock isn't tanking, but it's lower than it was six months ago.
* **All non-Lillard Blazers:** Dame is too good for the team to lose in the first round with a healthy roster.

Lastly, let's think about the narrative for the championship team, whoever it may be. I think at this point, regardless of who wins, it will be a redemption narrative:

* **Bucks**: Giannis takes the next step and solidifies himself as not just a great athlete but a top tier player who deserves the MVP accolades. Coach Bud also probably gets some redemption narrative going (though I personally still don't think he's been very good).
* **Suns**: CP3 and Booker are vindicated.
* **Clippers**: PG gets his flowers. Ty Lue gets a *ton* of praise.
* **Hawks:** Trae's getting ""he's a top 5 player"" buzz and Nate McMillan gets his due.

The highest expectations here are on the Bucks, and Giannis' injury even takes that off. So I think this is more of a championship for a team to win than it is one for a team to lose. That makes the positive stories even more compelling.

"nbadiscussion","Desmondo110","A comparison of FTA per 36 in the Regular Season vs. Post Season 2015 - 2021","2021-01-07 9:22:03 AM","The NBA announced that it would be changing the rules to help curb some of the unnatural motion that players use to game the rules and draw fouls.  The announcement specifically called out Trae Young and James Harden, but this could also be applied to many other foul baiters, like Joel Embiid, Chris Paul, and Kevin Durant.  During the post season, it is not uncommon to see these master baiters complain to the refs after not getting a call that they may have gotten dozens of times in the regular season or earlier rounds of the playoffs.  Are these players actually getting fewer fouls called for them in the post season compared to the regular season?

I wanted to determine if the players are actually getting fewer fouls in the post season.  Using Basketball Reference player statistics for the regular season and post season dating back to 2015, I tried to accomplish just that.  To take out any bias that might be created by small sample sizes, I removed any player-season, where the player played fewer than 500 regular season minutes and fewer than 80 post season minutes.  I then calculated the number of FTA per 36 minutes in the regular season and the post season for each player-year.  I then created a scatter plot with the X-axis as regular season FTA per 36 and Y-axis of post season FTA per 36.  If players were getting fouled at the same rate in the regular season as the post season, a linear regression would have a slope of 1, so I added this ideal line to the chart in black.  I also added the actual linear regression line to the chart, which can be seen below in blue:

The linear regression model has slope of 0.91 and an intercept of 0.23, which indicates that a theoretical player who draws zero fouls per 36 in the regular season would draw .23 fouls per 36 in the post season.  On the flip side, a player that leads the league in fouls drawn in the regular season would have the biggest drop in FTA in the playoffs.  This can be seen by how the blue linear regression line clearly starts to deviate away from the ideal line at around 5 FTA per 36.  It appears as if players that draw few fouls in the regular season are being rewarded with additional FTA in the post season and players that drew more fouls in the regular season are being punished with fewer FTA in the playoffs.  

This effect is likely the result of a combination of factors: defenders learning more of the offensive players foul baiting tricks over the course of a 7 game series and refs changing how they ref in the post season, and ""letting the players play.""  It begs to the question if refs should ref the same way in the regular season and post season?

"nbadiscussion","Karametric","Thoughts on Game 1 - 2021 Finals?","2021-07-07 7:07:55 AM","Strangely, there is no thread here, or nothing already posted.

I'm not going to pretend like I have some unique things to say, but I do have some thoughts, and hopefully other's have more insightful things to say.  

First, the Suns' guard tandem really shows the value of the midrange, even in this age of efficiency.  When defenses get tougher in the playoffs/finals, and when there is more time to game plan and prepare, the easy buckets and threes often get taken away, and having one, or even two players who can use screens, get mismatches, or even iso up and get to spots in the midrange and score is invaluable.  

Second, Giannis looked healthy, but completely disappeared for most of the game after a strong first quarter.  Suddenly, with 4 minutes left and the game pretty much out of reach, he became super active and energetic.  Very disappointing game for him, and for the Bucks, who just seem to be much more a great regular season team/average playoff team.  Giannis' game just is too limited it seems, he's got no versatility, and really looked like he didn't want to go the line.  Bud is at fault here too.  Giannis, not coincidently, was active (if not good, maybe) when Bud finally went to him as a center and played a small ball line up.  It was too little, too late, but we'll see it again if Bud is smart, so maybe we'll see it.  

Third, CP3 and Booker were really hunting mismatches on big men and feasting on them.  Bud either needs to change his defensive scheme, or play more Giannis at the 5, but that really seems like something Giannis can only do in spurts.  Paul was amazing in these matchups and really looked in full control of the game from the second quarter on.  We may see the worst contract in sports win the Finals MVP.","t3_ofjltq","https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/ofjltq/thoughts_on_game_1_2021_finals/",58,25,"t1_h4dg30x","2021-07-07 10:03:09 AM","Bucks are going to blow this one because Bud can't make adjustments in game to save his life. It was laughable how easily PHX was getting whatever they wanted in the 3rd and him just letting the lead balloon like that. Middleton getting hot from beyond the arc kept them in it, but that's no recipe for success long term in this series. Giannis looking less than 100% is also giving them very little to work with. They are going to get absolutely crushed by the CP3/Booker tandem just forcing those switches and making them pay all series long.  And we already know that the Bucks are damn near incapable of doing the same thing based on this postseason. The Bucks being a really dumb team is going to come to full fruition here; there's no way that Chris Paul is letting this opportunity slip away if he's healthy enough to play throughout this series. Both he and Booker are way too good as playmakers to swarm them, the Suns have great perimeter shooting throughout, and Ayton is always available for easy finishes and cuts to the rim once the defense collapses.  If Giannis gets healthier then they could push it to 6, but I think it's more realistically Phoenix in 5.",9,0.112,0.73,0.159,0.9031,3.09
"nbadiscussion","dj_craw","Team USA could be so good its unbelievable","2021-28-06 2:46:47 PM","Before I get going, I wanna preface this with if everybody was healthy and wanted to participate. 

First point I have is that Team USA could potentially LeBron James, Stephen Curry, Damian Lillard, James Harden, Kawhi Leonard,  Kevin Durant, and Anthony Davis. I think everybody can agree these guys would all have a spot if they were healthy and wanted to. So no real arguments to make here.

Next we can talk about the 2nd tier of guys who could get in. We wont need to mention a third tier becayse theres only 12 roster spots and 1st tier of guys take up 7 already. Guys I think of include KAT, Bam, Tatum, Trae, Booker, Beal, Holiday, Middleton, Kyrie, Jimmy Butler, Jaylen Brown, Donovan Mitchell,  CP3, Ayton, PG13, and Klay Thompson.

Zion Williamson also comes to mind. I would definitely have him on my roster, as hes a player whos probably at the top of the list above but I had to mention why reeaaal quick bc hes sooooo speeciaaall. This dude shoots upwards of 95% of all his field goal attempts within 10 feet of the basket. 70% within 3 feet. On 17 field goal attempts a game hes made upwards of 60% of them. The defense knows where hes going, he should be easy to gameplan against with Steven Adams and Eric Bledsoe not spacing the floor whatsoever. Zion with elite spacing would be unbelievable.

Some honorable mentions include SGA, Fox, Ingram, DeRozan, Draymond, CJ, Jamal Murray, Randle, Grant, Lavine, Ja Morant, and RWB.

Plenty still run twin towers, so while the USA can simply out-talent most teams they could struggle heavily against big teams. Davis at the 5 would be fine if you had Miami Lebron manning the 4, but even then AD is not as physical as true 5s, and a lot of international centers play at upwards of 260, 270 lbs. I could get behind playing AD and Bam at the same time, but any smaller and they could get manhandled inside. I'm pretty sure team USA will have someone like Brook Lopez to spell those kinds of big teams, even if he stays on the bench for most other games. You can say USA small ball can always run opposing bigs off the floor but you can't rely on small ball working every game, especially if your shooters go cold and you struggle to rebound or force turnovers to get out in transition.",3,0.023,0.852,0.125,0.962,3.25
"nbadiscussion","saugaman99","The Suns defensive strategy against Giannis","2021-12-07 6:18:59 PM","I’m not saying I’ve gone full film study on this or anything, but my impression is the Suns are not giving as much extra defensive attention to Giannis and not building a wall as much as some other teams since the Toronto series. Crowder looked like he was being left on an island last game. On the other hand the Suns have probably defended the rest of the Bucks a little better. So Giannis goes for 40 but if the rest of the team struggles it’s not enough.

This is a strategy I like against a team like Dwight Magic who was surrounded by lights out guys but I’m not sure the Bucks are the best to use it against. Their personnel isn’t totally lights out in terms of shooting and one of the issues is they play at such a high defense and rebounding intensity that they are gassed on offense hence why a player like Holiday has been hot/cold on offense since he is everywhere on defense. I would take my chances with bigs like Tucker, Lopez and Portis open from 3 in the long run if it means defending Giannis better, they may hit some but I don’t know if they can win the series that way.

The list is Giannis, Luka, Kawhi, Bron, AD, Dame, Steph, Harden, Joker, KD, Embiid.

I posted on this sub a couple of weeks ago about the potential of Booker becoming a BPCT and after Trae’s run that he is having, I have the same elusive question. I think it’s accepted that there are 11 guys that are BPCT worthy, where if you put them on a team with another BPCT guy + anselory pieces (ex. Bron and AD) or a second-best guy with great role players (ex. Kawhi and PG) or a second and third guy with meh to crap role players (ex. Giannis, Jrue, Middleton), these are all theoretical Larry O’Brien worthy teams.

There are a few guys that I think are on the fringe of this tier right now but have arguments of why they haven’t accomplished what they “should have”: Embiid, Giannis, Dame, Harden, and AD. 

The first thing I thought about in regard to Trae is what does he have to do to rise to this top tier? I think we have to start with what all these guys have in common (this all theoretical and arguable). 

&#x200B;

1. If you throw two BPCT guys together (barring injury) they have to make the finals.
2. They have to be able to average at least 25 in the playoffs and be at least a neutral on defense.
3. They have to beat another BPCT guy on their way to, or in the Finals. 
4. At any point in time you can make an argument they are the best player in the world.

There might be more or less qualifiers, but I think this is sufficient. 

I think if Trae beats the Bucks you can make the argument he has gone above and beyond, going against three incredible defensive teams and two BPCT’s. This is where the argument starts because if he doesn’t beat Giannis the argument can’t be made IMO. (Side Note: If Giannis loses with a theoretically far better team, he gets moved out of this tier for me). After that, I think he has to at the very least have a 2019 Paul George type MVP next year where he is solidly in the race. Finally, he has to get to at least the second round next year.

To sum it up IMO for Trae to become a BPCT he has to beat Giannis, has an MVP-like season next year, and Get to the second round next year.","t3_o7reez","https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/o7reez/is_trae_a_best_player_on_a_championship_team_guy/",17,35,"t1_h30vvoo","2021-25-06 11:38:30 AM","I argued with someone on here a year ago about this.

For anyone who doesn't know what RAPM is, it basically looks at a player's plus-minus every single possession of every single game over the time frame, and then adjusts it based on who his teammates were on the floor and who the defenders were on the floor, and adds it all up in some complex statistical analysis to estimate a player's impact. **There's no box score stats whatsoever when calculating RAPM.**

Long-term multiyear RAPM is considered the gold standard of NBA advanced stats and all modern advanced stats are built upon it. Since it's an objective calculation using solely plus-minus on a possession by possession basis with no box score stats whatsoever, it's considered the least biased way to evaluate a player's impact. Of course, no stat is without its faults, and even this 10 year time frame can underrate players who were developing in the beginning (like Dirk, Chris Paul, Lebron) or aging at the end (Tim Duncan, Ray Allen). Also just to note that this is only regular season over this time frame. 

Here's the source: https://sites.google.com/site/rapmstats/10-year-rapm. I only wanted to look at offense for this post. 

Tied 1st: Kobe Bryant/Lebron James, 

2nd: Dwayne Wade, 

3rd: Steve Nash, 

4th: Chris Paul, 

5th: Manu Ginobli, 

6th: Baron Davis, 

7th: Antawn Jamison, 

8th: Jason Kidd, 

Tied 9th: Dirk Nowitzki/Ray Allen, 

10th: Chauncey Billups

Anything interesting from these rankings? Anything that pops out? I think pertaining to Kobe Bryant the results are interesting as often in the current day there seems to be some people who portray Kobe Bryant as an inefficient scorer compared to other all-time greats when in reality his offensive impact was unparalleled during his time. His shot creation ability on very high volume on good efficiency along with his playmaking was clearly extremely efficient offense. Seeing Baron Davis here is also a big surprise. Ginobli is also somewhat surprising but most people who watched him play can attest to just how potent his offense was. He was James Harden before James Harden. 

Seeing guys like Antawn Jamison, Baron Davis, Jason Kidd ranked above Dirk (I must add that they're very slightly above him) is a headscratcher, but when you look at a 6 year RAPM from 2006 to 2011, Dirk's offense is ranked 3rd, so clearly Dirk had improved a ton from 2002 to 2006.  

Something that I thought was interesting to note was that Antawn Jamison was a TERRIBLE defender despite the elite offense. Despite being 7th in offensive RAPM, his total RAPM was ranked in 52 because of his terrible defense. 

And of course Lebron James tied at 1st also is interesting but not too surprising. Crazy when this time frame also includes his first two years when he was still developing, AND most of this time frame is before his true prime.

Secondly my analysis comes from everything James wanted in Houston vs what he could have had.

1. Chris Paul. CP3 and Harden were a great tandem till their personal relationship broke down. James wanted him out and Morey pulled the trigger and sent him to OKC. Now CP3 is leading the young suns into the WCF.

2. Clint Capela. This guy was an elite rebounder for James and he opened up his offense. If James missed a shot Clint was there to keep the offense going. Clint had to be moved since him and Russ clogged the court for James. Now Clint is helping the Hawks in the ECF with another free shooter in Ice Trae.

3. PJ Tucker. James always didn’t like how he didn’t have superstar talent next to him but PJ is a horse. One of the hardest working players in the league and a 3 point shooter. Now he’s in the ECF with the Bucks.

4. Mike D’Antoni. James loved MDA since he turned him from a good scorer to an elite one. MDA coddled him and the team into believing they could sacrifice easy 2 for 3 point shots. Harden followed him to Brooklyn and now they are watching from home. 

5. Daryl Morey. Another guy who coddled James. DM was never afraid to make a risky move that helped James win a title. When he left James wanted out. Now DM is stuck with Ben Simmons trying to prove he can win with Morey ball.

6. Brooklyn Nets. James finally gets his super team but he joins an often injured KD and Kyrie. It ends up not working this season due to his and Kyries injury.

7. Rafael Stone. James didn’t want to give Stone a chance in building a team around him. Stone could have offloaded Russ to the Knicks for expiring contracts to start the rebuild but he went for John Wall to give Harden a chance to consider staying here. Stone got ridiculed for not trading James for Ben Simmons but now it looks like it worked out for the Rockets as they aren’t stuck with Ben and we have the #2 pick.

8. Stephen Silas. This is a coach who James wouldn’t give a chance to. Didn’t show up to training camp. Turns out the players love him and even ex players like Luka Doncic are a starting to realize how important he was.

9. Christian Wood. A player that James really needed. A pick and pop big that he could have used in the playoffs that he didn’t want to give a chance to.

I’m not saying if James stayed we win a title this year. I’m just saying all the reasons he wanted out are starting to hurt his legacy.","t3_o70n95","https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/o70n95/the_playoffs_this_year_is_a_testament_to_james/",3,1,"t1_h3i922y","2021-29-06 5:51:28 PM","What a run though!

The bulls had a starting lineup of Harper, Jordan, Pippen, Rodman and Longly, (with kukoc off the bench) while the 86 Celtics ran a 5 of Johnson, Ainge, Bird, McHale and Parish. I believe the Celtics could beat them for a number of reasons:
1. They have a great defender to potentially challenge and maybe limit the sting of Jordan (yes I understand that no one can ever stop Jordan). I am saying that Johnson could reduce some of the damage done by Jordan. 
2. The Celtics have great star power with a very good big 3 of Bird McHale and Parish. Prime bird is a top 5 player of all time (in my opinion) and was basically just as unstoppable as Jordan on offence. He was also a pretty good defender. McHale was a dominant post/midrange scorer while being a very skilled paint defender. Had good size and strength down low. Parish was an elite interior defender and an anchor down low, how could also get efficient points around the rim. 
3. Celtics dominate down low. Rodman can’t guard both McHale and Parish down low by himself. Longly is going to be given straight buckets by who ever he is guarding whether it is parish or McHale. McHale or parish could also use their height advantage over Rodman to their advantage. 
4. This low post offence will matter near the end of games between these teams as the score will be close. The games will be low scoring affairs as both teams have 4 very good/elite defenders in their starting lineups. Both teams will try to expose any weaknesses in the opponents in 4th quarters.

For instance, there is a huge group of people that defend players like Westbrook, Giannis and Gobert despite the fact that they have come up short of expectations in the playoffs.

If you get off to a horrific start, that’s enough to make a player or coach change. But if you roll along fine, have to deal with injuries, or stay at least competitive, it’s harder to judge off regular season.  Playoffs are a much more accurate gauge. That’s the moment you get to see coaches under pressure. How do they make adjustments? How do they handle adversity? Can they get the most out of their best players in the big moments when it matters?  Playoff results are much more telling for what a coach actually is. For example, guys like Mike Budenholzer and Doc Rivers have strange rotations that usually get picked apart. Coaches like Ty Lue are shown to be full of adjustments and making minutes count. Coaches like Spo and Pop find a way to get the most out of their players and run good systems when it matters.

I think it also boils down to the fact that a coach's playoff adjustments' success seems pretty binary to the average fan -- it either works or doesn't. Taking the players you mentioned into account, all three of those guys have had perimeter-centric All-Stars who can create this ""gray area."" If someone else plays well (and even if the team loses), they just won't receive as much flak because it wasn't totally explicit and got overshadowed. For Gobert, I think Game 1 of the West semis was a great example of this. He struggled on offense and mostly had a limited defensive impact unlike his dominance in the regular season. But he got the game-winning block and Mitchell dropped 45, so his struggles just weren't as apparent. Then look at Bud, who got a ton of criticism even after beating the Nets in Game 7. The play he drew up at the end of regulation which ended in that horrible fadeaway baseline shot was entirely on him. Why? Because in a fan's eyes he's the singular guy in charge. Without anyone else visibly at his position (a star has teammates, a coach doesn't have a co-head coach), there's no other place to distribute blame that stems from a sideline mistake. A player on the other hand, isn't supposed to be ""the guy in charge."" If that were truly the case, they would probably (and rightfully) get the benefit of the doubt from not having any help.

"nbadiscussion","orwll","Takeaways from Bucks-Hawks Game 2?","2021-25-06 9:10:42 PM","Some theories/thoughts I have: 

* The main way teams have exploited the Bucks drop coverage is outside shooting, but the Hawks haven't been a good three point shooting team this playoffs. Trae is a good difficult shot maker, but he's also streaky- nights like this 1-8 aren't entirely out of the norm. 
* The Bucks did a good job taking away Trae's playmaking and forcing turnovers. 3 assists and 9 turnovers is a really bad game for him. The Hawks don't have that reliable second guy who can create his own shot, so much of their roster depends on Trae's playmaking or Trae's gravity to draw defensive attention. I thought Brook Lopez in particular did a really great job on Trae. 
* The trend of Giannis taking fewer jumpshots = better performance continues. He shot eight shots outside the restricted area tonight, and was 2-8 on those shots. That move on Hill/Capela was really alluring, I think everyone would rather he adds to his arsenal of post moves than keep working on his outside shooting. 
* I think the Bucks' drop coverage did a good job of taking away Trae's shots at the rim. He only took four shots in the paint tonight, and all were on the very edges, none in the restricted area. Last game, he attempted fourteen shots in the paint, and six in the restricted area. Trae only shot three free throws tonight, possibly because he was shooting more from deep and not attacking the rim.","t3_o83iac","https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/o83iac/takeaways_from_buckshawks_game_2/",30,11,"t1_h34wt9y","2021-26-06 12:25:42 PM","Game 2 was an extreme version of how I expected the series would go. Bucks would force the Hawks into difficult shots, get into passing lanes and get into transition.  The Bucks probably won't shoot 60 percent from three in a half again, but if they shoot ~40 percent that just means they win by 10 instead of 30. The Hawks transition defense was a huge problem even against Philly and the Bucks are even tougher on the break. This is the definitely the season for huge series turnarounds, but I don't see it for the Hawks this time. They can steal another game if Lou Will catches fire, or Giannis gets into foul trouble, but barring further injuries I have a hard time picturing them beating the Bucks three more times.",6,0.161,0.71,0.129,-0.7169,2.79

My understanding of Bird would be similar to how guys who started watching ball in the 2010's understand Kobe so I'm certainly not the authority here but with that being said I would probably take Bird over Durant (whose career i've definitely been around for since the beginning).  Bird I think would have functioned similar to a more athletic and smaller Jokic with an even higher BBIQ or a less athletic but more crafty and overall better Luca. Now I personally don't believe Bird would have been as good today relative to the rest of the league as he was back in the 80's, can't see him winning 3 straight MVP's for example, but a slightly less good Bird is still better than peak Durant. Bird literally did everything significantly better than KD except for scoring and even in that department it was close. KD is maybe a tier or a half tier above Bird as a scorer and IMO KD is a top 3ish scorer of all time but Bird was a generationally gifted scorer, a generationally gifted playmaker, an excellent rebounder for his position and a better defender than KD. Less importantly but it's still a facotr, in terms of intangibles as well Bird's killer instinct is on that MJ/Kobe level while KD is just doesn't seem to have that compared to those guys at least.  Now with all that being said, I do think Birds relative lack of athleticism does hurt him a bit in todays game. Bird wasn't a bad athlete but he was pretty average for an NBA athlete in the 80's and while the best players from the 80's are right on par with todays best players athletically, the overall athleticism of the league has certainly made leaps and bounds today compared to then. Given that, I do think the overall openness and spacing of todays game does make up for a wide majority of that drop in athleticism relative to his peers.",1,0.049,0.776,0.175,0.9946,3.25

The league was FAR more athletic in '92 than when he was drafted in 1979, and at that point Bird was 4 years into horrific back problems. In that '92 season, he had to lay down on the sidelines to keep his back stretched out because standing up from sitting was too painful, and he was in traction throughout the season. He was 35 years old and super busted; here's what he did that year:  **20 ppg, 10 rpg, 7 apg, 47/41/93** (*FG/3FG/FT*) At times he was basically stuck out on the perimeter due to lack of mobility, so he would do things like have [14 assists and 1 turnover in a huge playoff win](https://www.basketball-reference.com/boxscores/199205150BOS.html) (*his 2nd-to-last game ever*).

Deep threes, highlight transition dunks, alley-oop posters, are what people tune in for, especially overseas where the game is growing more and more every year.

Because of this, instead of the CP3-Ayton connection that we all tuned in to watch, we got CP3-Frank the Tank. It’s the finals, and we are not seeing the best basketball possible because of a seemingly arbitrary foul limit. 


I don’t think it’s good for the game to have the best players sitting on the bench for large stretches of the game in what is essentially a “time out” for bad behavior. Imagine if Chris Godwin had to sit out of the 3rd quarter of the Super Bowl because he had been called for holding too much in the first half. 

Also, so many calls in the NBA are judgement calls and if a few iffy whistles come your way, it could change your entire game plan by removing one of your best players. It becomes a huge issue in OT and 2OT games when the game is literally longer than normal but the foul limit stays at 6. Every time I see a 2OT game it seems like people are fouling out left and right. 

What is the point of the foul limit? If the goal is to discourage “dirty” play, is the limit too low?

I think at the very least, the limit should be raised to 8. Deandre Ayton was not playing dirty last night. He wasn’t being a menace, and he didn’t deserve to be removed from the game for such a long stretch. And if we are going to eject players for committing common fouls, I think they should have to foul A LOT before actually being ejected.

I personally think the argument against any of these teams is invalid, as making a competitive conference finals validates you itself IMO. But, I would like to pose this as a discussion. I think the playoff paths of the Suns, Hawks, and 2020 Lakers are all relatively similar, so if you were to say one doesn’t belong, i think you would need to say they all don’t belong. Let’s break it down:

Round 1:

3 points -> Suns: 4-2 over Lakers

- Lebron just back from injury, AD misses 2.5 games, CP3 injures his shoulder, has limited minutes, and can barely shoot. Suns easily handle the hobbled defending champs in 6

2 points -> Lakers: 4-1 over Portland 

- Dame misses game 5, CJ plays with a broken back, and the Lakers handedly take care of a team that barely snuck into the playoffs

1 point -> Hawks: 4-1 over the Knicks

- Hawks easily take care of a feel good first-time playoff team in 5

I think the advantage here goes to the Suns, with the Lakers and Hawks about even, but I’ll give the Lakers the edge since the Blazers have more star power and experience.

Round 2:

3 points -> Lakers 4-1 over Houston

- Russ has a very poor series after returning from both Covid and an injury that kept him mostly out of round 1. The Rockets also miss one of their key pieces in Danuel House after game 2. After some early close games, the Lakers easily handle Harden and the Rockets.

2 points -> Hawks 4-3 over Philadelphia 

- Playing without a starter in Hunter, the Hawks take down the #1 seed in the 76ers who are missing Danny Green. Yes, it’s a long, tight series, but this is a solid win over a good team with a great player.

1 point -> Suns: 4-0 over Denver

- Suns sweep an outclassed Denver team missing their second best player in Jamal Murray. CP3 has an incredible series, Ayton (kinda) slows down the MVP. 

I’d say the Lakers had the toughest series here, but I think the Hawks are close. I really think the 76ers were a very, very good team, but so were the Rockets and the Lakers handled their business better. The Nuggets had finals potential with Murray healthy.

Round 3: 

3 points -> Suns 4-2 over Clippers

- Yes, the Clippers were missing Kawhi, Ibaka, and Zubac, but this team was GOOD. They beat the #1 seed Jazz btb mostly without those guys (Zubac played some). The Clippers battled hard and definitely could have won the series, but keep in mind that the Suns took 2 games without their MVP-vote-getter in CP3, that’s huge. 

2 points -> Lakers 4-1 over Denver

- Solid win for the Lakers here. Many people felt Denver was similar to how they feel about the Hawks this year, giving them no chance to win. But, this Denver team was resilient and very good, and beat two good teams in the Jazz and Clippers. Solid win for the Lakers.

1 point -> Hawks 4-3 over Bucks (if it happens)

- if the Hawks can come back and win the series, it will be another win against an elite team. Yes, they were down 2-1, but YES they were up 15 without Trae against a mostly healthy Bucks team in game 4 (Divencenzo I remember you). If Giannis doesn’t return, being almost tied 2-2 with a btb MVP and the consensus #2 team in the East is no slouch.

Here I give the edge to the Suns, but it’s really another toss up between them and the Lakers. The Hawks are a close 3rd.

After 3 rounds, the Suns and Lakers are tied at #1 with 7. The Hawks have 4. With that being said, I think a Hawks finals win over a healthy Suns would be valued more than the Lakers win over the Heat, who were missing both Bam and Dragic for much of the series. If the Suns beat the Bucks with Giannis, that would be the most impressive win for sure. Beating the Hawks or the Bucks without Giannis would be similar to the Lakers win.

tldr; I don’t think there is much difference between the playoff paths of the Suns and Hawks this year, or the Lakers last season. Whichever team wins the finals, they PROVED THEMSELVES.

Trade #1 - Shake things up.  

Essentially an asset grab for PHI.  They get Wiggins, Okogie and two lottery picks this year.  They can use all of that for whatever they want to try and get for it, CJ, Siakam, whatever.  GSW adds a stud big man and can basically be the West Coast Nets.  Wolves get Simmons and Wiseman to pair with Edwards in a core that is more on the same time arc than Towns and Edwards.

Trade #2:  Oh Canada!  

This one looks a bit more Ujiri to me.  With Lowry likely out the door, Ujiri cashes in on Siakam and gets a haul in return.  Siakam-Curry-Thompson gives everyone in the West heartburn next year.  Meanwhile, the Raptors have 3 (!!) lottery picks this year, Wiggins goes back home and Wiseman comes along to help rebuild around the lottery haul.  FVV, Wiggins, Anunoby etc keep them respectably competitive while they help mentor the young stable of studs they have from this years draft.

Trade #3:  Change of scenery...

A little shell game with some of the leagues top stars.  Dame lands in Philly with Embiid forming a scary duo.  Siakam goes to Portland to team up with CJ and a squad that needed a little length come playoff time.  Toronto gets to try the Simmons rehab project stacking him next to FVV, OG and whatever young stud they get at #4 this year.  It's a rebuild without the rebuild.  Everyone wins.

You all probably seen the Trae shuffle highlight. The space Young was getting was rather defining in this matchup. It was just plain obvious on this particular action. Bucks enacted their defensive mindset of preventing paint PnR scoring and dropped their bigs, Portis and Lopez, to the paint to limit drives and circumvent the stack screen. 

So obviously they left the perimeter open. 

Crazy thing about Young's performance was that he actually could have been even better from deep. Most of his points came from top of the key/foul line mid ranges, which is precisely what the Bucks were giving him. 

&#x200B;

Is this defensive scheme something the Bucks should continue to deploy? Hawks kept coming at them with simple pick and rolls, and they were torching them all night. 

It's probably not realistic to expect Young averaging 50 in the series, but if they will keep the floor open to his shots, Hawks will find a way to leverage this to their favor. 

Can anyone smarter than me comment on this? Should the Bucks switch their defensive positioning to a perimeter switch focused defense? Or stick with the drop, because it provides more overall value here and let Young get his?","t3_o6ypon","https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/o6ypon/why_are_the_bucks_deploying_a_drop_scheme/",25,22,"t1_h2vvkpj","2021-24-06 6:54:59 AM","Bucks fan here, I have watched every game the last 3 years of Coach Buds tenure.  I have always felt that Bud designed the defense to stop their own offense. The basis is to limit was shots in the paint, because in Buds head, shooting an open 3 is alright because it is more difficult that getting a layup or midrange shot. He wants you to beat them by making a slightly more difficult shot. Theoretically that is true, but when you play in the NBA everyone and anyone will gladly shoot an open 3, and this time it just so happens to be the ECF.  Also, Brook Lopez may have reinvented the traditional big man offensive game with his 3pt shooting abilities, but he is still a slow moving traditional 5 that cannot keep up with guards on the perimeter, but will swat anything in the paint. In a series where Trae Young is the scorer and facilitator seeing Lopez 15 feet away from him off of a PnR is BBQ chicken.  It’s frustrating because this has always been the case for the Bucks defense. Teams shoot record amount of 3s and the Bucks are okay because they aren’t shooting closer to the basket. Surprisingly, Bud actually adjusted in the last half of the 4th to Giannis playing 5, which allowed him to guard Trae off of the double pick and pick him up above the 3pt line.

"nbadiscussion","phonebook_vertical","[Serious] Why doesn't a NBA team try to re-create a European All-Star team?","2021-28-06 7:27:39 PM","I had a YouTube suggestion today of the USA vs Spain 2012 Gold Medal game on YouTube. The US ended up winning 107-100 but this was a close game the whole way through. Tied going into halftime, tied going into the 4th. US had to have some clutch shots from Kobe to put the game away. Funny thing is - I'm old enough to remember this game and it wasn't even a surprise that the game was close. Spain was considered a force and while it would have been an upset - they had the ability to beat the US.

My question is why doesn't a NBA team - specifically a team that is already planning on tanking (OKC, maybe Orlando, etc) - commit to building an all European team? If this Spanish team could take a team of Kobe, Dwade, LeBron, KD, CP3, Harden, etc to the brink of elimination, clearly they could have succeeded in the NBA. I'll dive into this a little bit here but I would love to hear you alls comments as well.

To start, I want to discuss if it would be possible to build such a team - take the 2012 Spanish team for example. Marc and Pau Gasol would be the most expensive pieces from an asset acquisition standpoint quickly followed by Serge Ibaka. But after these three, the team is mostly convincing overseas players to come play in the NBA. This negotiation action costs nothing to a NBA team from an asset perspective because you're just signing them as FAs. In the off chance a team happens to own a players rights, a second rounder (possibly even protected) usually takes care of that.

Further - Juan Carlos Navarro (the teams third highest scorer) hadn't played in the NBA since '08, Rudy Fernandez was on the tail end of his NBA career, and Jose Calderon was a 10 ppg rotational player that could probably be acquired for a 2nd round pick. While the Gasols and Ibaka may have been slightly pricey, neither Gasol was near the top of their value from a trade perspective and I wouldn't consider any of these three even close to an ""untouchable"" such as a current day Luka, KD, Harden, etc. You could even time it where you're signing one or a couple of these guys as FAs and not giving up any assets.

I think building this team would have been possible for a 2012-2013 NBA team. If I told you I could give you a team that could give that star studded US team a run for their money - wouldn't you unload the warchest for that team? Also - big positive here - you can trade all your current assets so you may come out without having to unload too many future picks (aka teams about to enter a tank).

Next I want to discuss why(pros)/why not(cons) this team may work.

Pros: We all know European basketball is played and developed differently than the basketball in the US. There seems to be a higher interest in fundamentals and team play as opposed to IG highlights and AAU hero ball here in the US. Maybe this team could bring a ball movement and team approach that the NBA teams would have trouble stopping, ala the '14 Spurs. Maybe Euro players in the past have been thrown into the NBA's ""AAU environment"" and that environment contributed more to their downfall than their actual skillset. Maybe the overall talent level in Europe is higher than we expect and these players can hold their own with the best of the best when given a real opportunity. Even if the experiment doesn't work, you may not have given up many assets considering most players will just be signed via FA. You can just continue the tank and build through the draft.

Cons: It seems like you would have to go all in. To really give this experiment a shot - I don't think you can take that Spanish team and add a player like Rudy Gay and expect the skill sets to match. You'd probably have to bring in an international coaching staff too. Maybe it's a simple answer why this hasn't happened yet. There's a reason the majority of these guys aren't on NBA rosters and the average athleticism of the NBA is too overpowering and the team flops.

I was thinking about this further when considering this years Olympics. While I think the US will win - I think Spain could give them a challenge. This years Spanish team could be easily assembled as well, probably without even having to give any kind of first round pick. The US is only -360 to win the entire tourney with some of the top stars the NBA has to offer, which just seems low for a team with Lillard, Booker, Beal, KD, Bam, Tatum, etc. If this was an actual NBA team I feel like they'd be -1000 at least to win the whole Finals.

I'd love to hear you alls thoughts on this. Would you give this experiment a chance? Could that 2012 Spanish team won a NBA title? Would you be angry if your team tried something like this?","t3_o9z2ls","https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/o9z2ls/serious_why_doesnt_a_nba_team_try_to_recreate_a/",0,24,"t1_h3ehbr5","2021-28-06 8:41:24 PM","Don’t see this mentioned yet, but one of the primary reasons why the playing field is more even in international competition is that they play by FIBA rules and not NBA rules.",9,0,0.85,0.15,0.6486,4.5
"nbadiscussion","houstontrashbros","Realistic Ben Simmons trade possibilities","2021-21-06 11:01:07 AM","I've seen a lot of talk about trading Simmons, for obvious reasons, but most of it is just memes or dreams, so I wanted to actually take a look around and see if there are any real possibilities out there.

The first and most obvious that people are talking about is Ben for CJ McCollum.  While on it's face this looks like a win win for both teams, I doubt that Morey will see that as equal value.  I don't believe CJ is good enough to be the perimeter creator that they need to put them over the top, and I can see Portland being hesitant to send more assets back, when Simmons' value, despite being an all-star and all-defense player, is at an all time low.  Many people have also been speculating about a Lillard trade, but despite his recent tweets, nothing he has done has indicated that he wants to leave Portland, and the only way they trade him is if he pulls a Harden, which I don't think is in his character.

The next most obvious trade partner would probably be OKC, who's recent MO has been to take on these types of projects.  If I'm Morey, I'm seeing if I can get a deal done for SGA.  This would mean attaching picks to Simmons, but to me I see much more potential for SGA to be a top level perimeter creator than CJ.  From the OKC side, I can't see SGA as being untouchable when they have no clear picture of what their roster is going to look like even next year, and Simmons is only two years older.  The money isn't even close, but if I'm not mistaken the Thunder have 60m+ in space so they should just be able to absorb him into space.  Morey and Presti also have a very good working relationship, which certainly doesn't hurt.

Another obvious target would be Beal, for whom you'd have to send a king's ransom ala the packages for Harden, AD etc.  This, to me, is the highest guaranteed return though of the three trades, so I believe you have to pursue it.  One might say that the Wizards would never agree to pair up Russ and Simmons, but if they are trading Beal they are committing to a full rebuild until Russ's contract is up regardless, so being bad in the meantime would be beneficial.  If they can talk themselves into Ben developing more of an offensive game once he gets out of Philly, I could see them willing to do the deal for the right price.  I think the fit of Beal and Embiid would be basically perfect, game and personality wise, so I'd definitely be willing to go all in on it.  Are three or four firsts plus Simmons enough to get it done?  I'd throw in Maxey as well if I was Morey.

Finally, I would look at Zach Lavine.  Although he's basically a poor man's Beal, he is, again, at least a tier above CJ in my opinion and has shown continued improvement.  Chicago is reeling after going all in at the trade deadline and failing to make the playoffs, so they might be willing to entertain the possibility of a Simmons Lavine swap, especially if it recoups some of their draft stock.  On paper Simmons would mesh well with Vucevic, who is more of a stretch big than Embiid, would obviously do a lot for them on defense, and with Koby White on the roster would not have to shoulder all of the perimeter creation duties.  Again, you would have to attach picks, and this might be a sticking point if Chicago expect a Beal-esque package, but if they can convince themselves that they can rehabilitate Simmons, there might be a deal to be done.

After the comments from Embiid and Rivers, I think it's a foregone conclusion that Simmons is not on the Sixers roster at the start of next season, and it's going to be very interesting to see how it all plays out.","t3_o519sv","https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/o519sv/realistic_ben_simmons_trade_possibilities/",1,34,"t1_h2kj58u","2021-21-06 12:21:57 PM","Why would anyone trade for Ben simmons when you give up: SGA / Lavine / CJ You'd have to give a lot to get either of those guys.

"nbadiscussion","Diamond4Hands4Ever","Kawhi to the Hawks in FA?","2021-27-06 4:14:10 PM","If Kawhi decides to test the market in Free Agency this summer, I think the Hawks should definitely be on his radar. Here are some reasons why.

1. The Hawks don’t have to give up too much to get him. As it stands now, in order to clear enough cap space to give him the max (~$39.35 mil.), the Hawks would only have to renounce all their cap holds (including John Collins’), and dump the salaries of Gallo, Kris Dunn, and Bruno Fernando; sending those contracts and a 2nd-rounder or two to OKC probably does the job. 

That isn’t nothing — Gallo and John Collins are good players — but that doesn’t compare to Kawhi’s value, and the Hawks get to keep their young wings (Reddish, Huerter, and Hunter) and their 1st for this year.


2. The Hawks have the pieces to build a contender right now. As is, the Hawks’ core of Young, Hunter, Bogdanovic, Huerter, Capela, and Reddish are already pretty good, and have proven that the playoffs aren’t too big for them. Adding Leonard makes the Hawks true title contenders, and that’s before them rounding out their roster with vet Free Agents using their MLE and BAE. The Hawks could realistically field a lineup of

PG: Young
SG: Bogdanovic
SF: Hunter
PF: Leonard
C:  Capela 

with a second unit of 

PG: Ish Smith
SG: Huerter
SF: Reddish
PF: Bobby Portis
C: Okongwu / Vet Min. Big

That team is deep, versatile, and well-rounded: a good mix for playoff basketball. Note also that Nate McMillan seems perfectly capable as a coach and should be the Hawks HC long-term, which is a plus.


3. The Hawks have the flexibility to trade for a disgruntled star next year, and that could truly make them special. Unlike most other teams contending for titles, the Hawks have good young players on cheap contracts for next year, and have all of their draft picks. 

If a star like Bradley Beal or Zach Lavine demands a trade, the Atlanta Hawks can outbid other teams in order to acquire them via trade. They could really sweeten the pot with multiple young players, numerous first round picks, and an established vet while still being a title contender worthy of a star player’s respect and time. 

That’s something that the Clippers and many other contenders can’t do, which makes them significantly less capable of improving their rosters substantially. This is what makes the Hawks uniquely good as a free agent landing spot. Adding a third star to Trae Young and Kawhi Leonard in 2022 would be entirely possible and would make the Hawks a true force in the NBA for years to come.


Ultimately, I don’t think this will happen at all, but the Hawks have a lot to offer for Kawhi and would be a good destination for him. What do y’all think?

Note: I’m using Spotrac for the salary cap numbers.","t3_o97ye8","https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/o97ye8/kawhi_to_the_hawks_in_fa/",0,8,"t1_h3aeefo","2021-27-06 9:44:06 PM","Hawks won’t get Kawhi but what they can do is package some of their young players for a star player.

Btw the fit for Kawhi does make a lot of sense, but I think they realistically should go after a player like Bradley Beal through a trade.",1,0.025,0.805,0.17,0.9136,3.2

I know refs don’t always call all violations-traveling and 3 second rules come to mind. But watching refs hold the ball, ready to go, until Giannis finishes his pantomime free throw practice, and then almost never calling a violation when his shots go over 10 seconds is astonishing to me.  I don’t watch every game, so maybe they have cut others this same slack, but I haven’t seen anything like it in any game I’ve watched this year.  In that sense, the failure of the refs to follow the rule is uniquely benefiting a single team, and is therefore not the same as the laxity in the rules listed above, where they don’t strictly apply the rule even as most teams show violations. That’s a random following of the rule; this allowance for Giannis is a specific act that is repeated multiple times a game.  It also seems like the ref standing and waiting for Giannis to be ready, while everyone else on the court is ready and waiting, constitutes a delay of game. A player or coach would certainly get dinged for that kind of delay, wouldn’t they?  Even a recent nba last 2 minute report listed two 10 sec violations as Incorrect NonCalls. How are the referees allowed to continue exhibiting such bias in favor of only one team in their refusal to follow this rule for this single player?  I’ve seen arguments that they won’t change now because they set precedent throughout the season-that would work if this happened across the board to most teams, but it doesn’t. It is a delay of game, committed willfully and repeatedly by refs, to the benefit of a single player and a single team.  What is the rationale for refs causing a delay of game and exhibiting clear bias with their refusal to enforce this rule?",1,0.099,0.798,0.103,-0.2127,2.5300000000000002

Marc and Pau Gasol would be the most expensive pieces from an asset acquisition standpoint quickly followed by Serge Ibaka. But after these three, the team is mostly convincing overseas players to come play in the NBA. This negotiation action costs nothing to a NBA team from an asset perspective because you're just signing them as FAs. In the off chance a team happens to own a players rights, a second rounder (possibly even protected) usually takes care of that.

Further - Juan Carlos Navarro (the teams third highest scorer) hadn't played in the NBA since '08, Rudy Fernandez was on the tail end of his NBA career, and Jose Calderon was a 10 ppg rotational player that could probably be acquired for a 2nd round pick. While the Gasols and Ibaka may have been slightly pricey, neither Gasol was near the top of their value from a trade perspective and I wouldn't consider any of these three even close to an ""untouchable"" such as a current day Luka, KD, Harden, etc. You could even time it where you're signing one or a couple of these guys as FAs and not giving up any assets.

I think building this team would have been possible for a 2012-2013 NBA team. If I told you I could give you a team that could give that star studded US team a run for their money - wouldn't you unload the warchest for that team? Also - big positive here - you can trade all your current assets so you may come out without having to unload too many future picks (aka teams about to enter a tank).

Next I want to discuss why(pros)/why not(cons) this team may work.

Pros: We all know European basketball is played and developed differently than the basketball in the US. There seems to be a higher interest in fundamentals and team play as opposed to IG highlights and AAU hero ball here in the US. Maybe this team could bring a ball movement and team approach that the NBA teams would have trouble stopping, ala the '14 Spurs. Maybe Euro players in the past have been thrown into the NBA's ""AAU environment"" and that environment contributed more to their downfall than their actual skillset. Maybe the overall talent level in Europe is higher than we expect and these players can hold their own with the best of the best when given a real opportunity. Even if the experiment doesn't work, you may not have given up many assets considering most players will just be signed via FA. You can just continue the tank and build through the draft.

Cons: It seems like you would have to go all in. To really give this experiment a shot - I don't think you can take that Spanish team and add a player like Rudy Gay and expect the skill sets to match. You'd probably have to bring in an international coaching staff too. Maybe it's a simple answer why this hasn't happened yet. There's a reason the majority of these guys aren't on NBA rosters and the average athleticism of the NBA is too overpowering and the team flops.

I was thinking about this further when considering this years Olympics. While I think the US will win - I think Spain could give them a challenge. This years Spanish team could be easily assembled as well, probably without even having to give any kind of first round pick. The US is only -360 to win the entire tourney with some of the top stars the NBA has to offer, which just seems low for a team with Lillard, Booker, Beal, KD, Bam, Tatum, etc. If this was an actual NBA team I feel like they'd be -1000 at least to win the whole Finals.

I'd love to hear you alls thoughts on this. Would you give this experiment a chance? Could that 2012 Spanish team won a NBA title? Would you be angry if your team tried something like this?","t3_o9z2ls","https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/o9z2ls/serious_why_doesnt_a_nba_team_try_to_recreate_a/",0,24,"t1_h3eht9i","2021-28-06 8:46:03 PM","So, basically is the premise here that it is the summer after the 2012 Olympics? So why didn’t someone like the Magic or Bobcats try to get the entire Spanish team on their roster? Well you’d have to get Pau from the Lakers, Marc from the Grizzlies, and Ibaka from the Thunder. That seems difficult to do for any team that doesn’t already have one of those guys. But let’s just say the Grizzlies go for it. They trade Randolph and picks for Pau, then Conley and picks for Ibaka. (No idea if these trades work, I’m just thinking out loud.) Then you have to convince Navarro to come back (Memphis actually already had his rights but he wanted to play in Spain). Same for Fernandez, though Denver had his. After that you have to get Rubio from Minnesota, Calderon from Toronto, and Claver from Portland. All three should be theoretically doable. The other guys (Llull, Rodriguez, Reyes, Abrines) all play in Spain, and like Navarro and Fernandez, you have to convince to come live in Memphis full time away from their homes, families, and culture. So basically the Grizzlies are the only team that I could see having had a realistic shot at even attempting this, but they would’ve had to blow up a promising young core, and probably overpay guys, just in the hope that it works as well in the NBA as it does in FIBA.",5,0.007,0.886,0.107,0.9733,3.0700000000000003
"nbadiscussion","Kairyu_gen1","Kristaps Porzingis for Ben Simmons","2021-28-06 1:17:43 AM","Following underwhelming playoff performances the knee-jerk reactions of both Mavericks and Sixers fans have been fairly predictable. Both fanbases see a clear #1 option on their team who needs more help from a suitable supporting cast. 

For the Sixers; Embiid is 27 with two more years left on his contract (https://www.spotrac.com/nba/philadelphia-76ers/joel-embiid-15355/). After a near-MVP season that really signalled the Big Man having hit his prime there is probably more urgency to Philly's need for all hands on deck in the quest for the chip. Embiid has battled with injuries for much of his career, but his high value on both ends of the floor is by now tried and true.

For the Mavericks; two losses to the Clippers in a row is... what it is? There is a narrative that both losses were 'hard-fought' and generally a credit to the Mavs squad, but in the end a loss is a loss. I have my doubts that Doncic, a well-documented competitor, is going to be satisfied with first-round exits for long. Being 22 and on a team built around him from the ground up, however, probably affords the Mavericks ownership and front office some breathing room in comparison to the Sixers.

Both the Sixers' and the Mavs' 2nd options have, as mentioned, had disappointing post-season performances. Simmons' fit with Embiid has been discussed extensively for years, while Porzingis' sour relationship with Doncic and injury history has grated on the patience of many Mavs fans. 

Both teams could of course keep their assets; Simmons is an all-defense player with tremendous upside in transition, but his lack of a jump shot and, though a less concrete factor, lack of 'aggressiveness' and engagement detracts from his overall value. Embiid is a dominant force in the post; does Simmons' upsides make up for his lack of floor-spacing and, well, cluttering presence in the paint? For Porzingis, his value is the exact opposite; a 7'3 self-styled PF with an impressive jumper. Porzingis spaces the floor, but his defense - especially in the pick-and-roll - has been criticised. He also has a history of injuries that seem to have affected his athleticism, including shot-blocking and finishing ability.

The last year of Simmons' contract is 24-25, where he is owed 40 million plus change (https://www.spotrac.com/nba/philadelphia-76ers/ben-simmons-20206/). Porzingis' contract is slightly smaller and his last year is 23-24, where he is owed 36 million (https://www.spotrac.com/nba/dallas-mavericks/kristaps-porzingis-17832/).

Now, I wouldn't want to speculate about an exact trade package, but the idea of Simmons for Porzingis has intrigued me. In being traded both players escape less than desirable situations. Embiid's comment on the Sixers' game 7 are telling to me, and as mentioned before Porzingis' relationship with Doncic seems strained at best. They are both relatively young star players; 24 for Simmons and 25 for Porzingis, with known upsides and the potential for growth, or perhaps more accurately recovery in Porzingis' case.

For the Sixers, Porzingis would instantly open up the floor for Embiid. Despite a narrative of inefficiency the Latvian put up 20/9 on 47 FG%, shooting 37.6% from downtown this season. He can play the 4 and 5 interchangeably and can be counted on for isolation buckets when pressed. I believe a health...-ier Porzingis after a full off-season can offer dynamic range to a Sixers squad that could use it. Their starting 5 would look something like:

a) Curry/Milton, Green, Harris, Porzingis, Embiid.

Porzingis would also fit better next to often traditional backup big men like Howard, who will likely see more playing time when Embiid is out with injuries. And when Porzingis himself is out his absence just sees the Sixers go back to the kind of basketball they have been playing for 2-3 seasons now.
The trade costs the Sixers defensively, but even if Porzingis stands as still as a traffic cone his presence alone enables Embiid to operate more freely, perhaps in the process sparing him from getting so banged up by the constant double-teams Simmons invites when on the floor with Embiid.

For the Mavs, Simmons would be a devastating defensive presence for a team that has been sorely missing it. Simmons is one of the few legitimate 1-5 defenders in the league. On offense Simmons' athleticism and playmaking ability would make him a very hand-in-glove fit next to Doncic, who seems more comfortable with traditional rollers. At 6'10 Simmons can run, dunk, catch lobs and pass out of the post. I could also see him feasting on mismatches when fed down low. Doncic loves the deep post feeds against mismatches, as evidenced every single time Marjanovic touches the hardwood. For the Mavs, their starting 5 with Simmons would look something like:

b) Doncic, Hardaway Jr., Finney-Smith/Richardson, Powell/Kleber, Simmons

You could play Simmons at whatever position, so long as his role was clearly defined. The trade costs the Mavs in spacing, but not by much. The team's backup bigs are solid shooters and Powell especially can make a living above the rim catching lobs.

For both players there are questions about gumption. Both could retreat further into themselves and their bad habits: Porzingis taking post touches from Embiid or chucking above-the-break 3s on every catch is less than ideal. The same can be said for a version of Simmons that does not rebound, go hard in the paint, or run and roll with urgency. For Simmons especially, in my opinion, effort can be a big difference-maker. I do believe, however, that taking Embiid out of the equation opens up more of an opportunity for Simmons to see the paint as 'his territory'; a place where he can dominate without worrying about taking touches from Embiid. 

What do you guys think? Is this just another whacko proposal that would make either organization laugh? Let me know if you agree.","t3_o9fwen","https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/o9fwen/kristaps_porzingis_for_ben_simmons/",0,13,"t1_h3bmf1j","2021-28-06 7:15:31 AM","This is like the 5th time I've seen this idea on this sub and I hate it more each time.

The San Antonio Spurs were the no.1 seed in the 2010-11 season boasting a record of 61-21, good for the 2nd best record in the league. Meanwhile the Grizzlies were the 8th seed with a record of 46-26. In the First Round the Grizzlies beat the Spurs in 6 games. When i first discovered this, i was perplexed that almost no one had ever mentioned this happening before. You always hear about the ""We believe Warriors"" beating the Mavericks in 2007 yet this had never come up before. So I went to check if maybe the spurs had injuries to the Big Three and found that every player on the team played all 6 games of the series except for Manu who missed out on only 1 game, so injuries weren't the reason why this loss was excused. I have 2 questions about this.

1. To the fans who remember this happening, that either watched the games or know a bit more about this upset, how did the Grizzlies beat the Spurs? 
2. How did the Spurs and especially Tim Duncan/Tony Parker get away with this? If Kobe, Jordan, Lebron, Magic, Kareem, Durant, Curry, Harden EVER lost to an 8th seed in the first round, their legacies would be PERMANENTLY destroyed. This would be brought up on every discussion about them and would never escape their legacies. Yet I'm willing to bet 95% of fans here either don't know this happened or don't care.

So, as you can see, Ayton's run stacks up favorably in all four categories. Obviously he's getting lots of easy buckets from lobs/rim runs/put backs, but it's still incredibly impressive. Let's hope he keeps it up the rest of the way and that there's even better runs from him still to come!

Here is some analysis on how tonight’s game might go in Atlanta.

The Bucks have seemed figure out how to fluster the Hawks on defense. They put pressure on Trae by eliminating his space off the PnR and helping off of the perimeter. This was a key adjustment from game 1 where Milwaukee looked to stay home and let Trae beat them off of high-percentage floater looks.

Atlanta has to get really creative on offense, and they need great production from either of their secondary scoring options (Huerter or Bogi). If Milwaukee continues to help off the perimeter (which they will), Huerter or Bogi should look to be aggressive scorers in order to make the Bucks pay.

Keep in mind, the result of Atlanta’s misses were primarily due to the Bucks defense rather than variance. To combat this, Atlanta should look to fix their spacing issues with the John Collins and Clint Capella pairing. Capella isn’t a shooter, so a Trae/JC PnR isn’t an effective game plan since Capella’s defender is gonna help in the paint. They can try to rely on the Trae/Capella PnR, but Milwaukee is going to continue to sell out and help off of JC. I expect Collins to put up a bunch of threes today.

Offensively, the Bucks still don’t have much to worry about. Maybe Atlanta can try the wall, but they have attempted this and their wall is effective with defenders Bogi and Gallo. Their perimeter defenders weren’t aggressive enough in cutting off Giannis’s driving lanes. If they are more aggressive, however, the Bucks should resort to putting Giannis in screener situations and open up scoring opportunities for Jrue/Middleton as ball handlers.

Milwaukee probably will not shoot as efficiently as they did in game 2. However, they did not sway the game from the shooting; it was the defense and Giannis being aggressive in the paint. Also, they lost by 40 points, that tells you they were outmatched on both sides of the ball.

I expect the Bucks to continue the aggressive help on Trae, which will open up opportunities for Atlanta’s wings. He should become more of a willing passer out of the PnR, and their wings will have more production offensively - the only question is if they can score at an efficient rate. Collins will attempt more three point shots since Giannis tends to help off of him.

Overall, my prediction is the Bucks win somewhere around 10-15, with another big game from Jrue and Middleton getting into a groove. Let me know how you think this one goes!","t3_o94wng","https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/o94wng/bucks_vs_hawks_game_3_analysis_predictions_things/",147,8,"t1_h3ax1kn","2021-28-06 2:16:33 AM","I personally feel like the only way the bucks can lose this series is if they shoot themselves in the foot which they did in game 1.

I honestly have no clue what the hawks can do defensively against giannis and kinda against jrue holiday because they don’t have good defense pg.

"nbadiscussion","phonebook_vertical","[Serious] Why doesn't a NBA team try to re-create a European All-Star team?","2021-28-06 7:27:39 PM","I had a YouTube suggestion today of the USA vs Spain 2012 Gold Medal game on YouTube. The US ended up winning 107-100 but this was a close game the whole way through. Tied going into halftime, tied going into the 4th. US had to have some clutch shots from Kobe to put the game away. Funny thing is - I'm old enough to remember this game and it wasn't even a surprise that the game was close. Spain was considered a force and while it would have been an upset - they had the ability to beat the US.

My question is why doesn't a NBA team - specifically a team that is already planning on tanking (OKC, maybe Orlando, etc) - commit to building an all European team? If this Spanish team could take a team of Kobe, Dwade, LeBron, KD, CP3, Harden, etc to the brink of elimination, clearly they could have succeeded in the NBA. I'll dive into this a little bit here but I would love to hear you alls comments as well.

To start, I want to discuss if it would be possible to build such a team - take the 2012 Spanish team for example. Marc and Pau Gasol would be the most expensive pieces from an asset acquisition standpoint quickly followed by Serge Ibaka. But after these three, the team is mostly convincing overseas players to come play in the NBA. This negotiation action costs nothing to a NBA team from an asset perspective because you're just signing them as FAs. In the off chance a team happens to own a players rights, a second rounder (possibly even protected) usually takes care of that.

Further - Juan Carlos Navarro (the teams third highest scorer) hadn't played in the NBA since '08, Rudy Fernandez was on the tail end of his NBA career, and Jose Calderon was a 10 ppg rotational player that could probably be acquired for a 2nd round pick. While the Gasols and Ibaka may have been slightly pricey, neither Gasol was near the top of their value from a trade perspective and I wouldn't consider any of these three even close to an ""untouchable"" such as a current day Luka, KD, Harden, etc. You could even time it where you're signing one or a couple of these guys as FAs and not giving up any assets.

I think building this team would have been possible for a 2012-2013 NBA team. If I told you I could give you a team that could give that star studded US team a run for their money - wouldn't you unload the warchest for that team? Also - big positive here - you can trade all your current assets so you may come out without having to unload too many future picks (aka teams about to enter a tank).

Next I want to discuss why(pros)/why not(cons) this team may work.

Pros: We all know European basketball is played and developed differently than the basketball in the US. There seems to be a higher interest in fundamentals and team play as opposed to IG highlights and AAU hero ball here in the US. Maybe this team could bring a ball movement and team approach that the NBA teams would have trouble stopping, ala the '14 Spurs. Maybe Euro players in the past have been thrown into the NBA's ""AAU environment"" and that environment contributed more to their downfall than their actual skillset. Maybe the overall talent level in Europe is higher than we expect and these players can hold their own with the best of the best when given a real opportunity. Even if the experiment doesn't work, you may not have given up many assets considering most players will just be signed via FA. You can just continue the tank and build through the draft.

Cons: It seems like you would have to go all in. To really give this experiment a shot - I don't think you can take that Spanish team and add a player like Rudy Gay and expect the skill sets to match. You'd probably have to bring in an international coaching staff too. Maybe it's a simple answer why this hasn't happened yet. There's a reason the majority of these guys aren't on NBA rosters and the average athleticism of the NBA is too overpowering and the team flops.

I was thinking about this further when considering this years Olympics. While I think the US will win - I think Spain could give them a challenge. This years Spanish team could be easily assembled as well, probably without even having to give any kind of first round pick. The US is only -360 to win the entire tourney with some of the top stars the NBA has to offer, which just seems low for a team with Lillard, Booker, Beal, KD, Bam, Tatum, etc. If this was an actual NBA team I feel like they'd be -1000 at least to win the whole Finals.

I'd love to hear you alls thoughts on this. Would you give this experiment a chance? Could that 2012 Spanish team won a NBA title? Would you be angry if your team tried something like this?","t3_o9z2ls","https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/o9z2ls/serious_why_doesnt_a_nba_team_try_to_recreate_a/",0,24,"t1_h3ehbr5","2021-28-06 8:41:24 PM","Don’t see this mentioned yet, but one of the primary reasons why the playing field is more even in international competition is that they play by FIBA rules and not NBA rules.",9,0,0.85,0.15,0.6486,4.5

Obviously the NBA subsidizes its female counterpart, but for how long?

With the recent pandemic, the NBA economy took a blunt hit and some teams are still suffering from the aftermath, as the league missed its projected revenue by $1.5 billion (!) in 2020. So it's safe to say the commissioner's hand will surely be tighter with cash for the foreseeable future, even though $10 million is essentially chump change by NBA standards.

But the more interesting question is why?

Why does the NBA still ever-so-mercifully allow the WNBA to exist? The latter's ratings are dwindling, players are always in conflict with the leadership and are constantly expressing their frustrations with unfair CBA agreements and stipulations that lead to lower percentages of revenue than their male counterparts. Isn't all of that too much of a burden for all parties concerned? Or is the WNBA just an expensive marketing tool for the league to be branded as an open-to-all, global sports conglomerate, which is part of Silver's ""global game"" philosophy, as we've seen with the expanding fanbases in Asia (especially the Philippines), Europe and North Africa?

The 5 Biggest Stock Risers During These NBA Playoffs

The NBA is interesting because during the regular season, fans and media members overreact to players’ performances and form their “player rankings”, only for the playoffs to come around and completely dismantle the aforementioned ranking system. I say this to make the point that when we TRULY think about who the best players in the world are, we need to more heavily consider what they do in May, June and July as opposed to what they do when half of the teams are load managing. For example, take a guy like Julius Randle. He made 3rd team all-NBA (as he should have) because he had a remarkable regular season, leading a Knicks team that played their hearts out in all 72 of their games and earned a 4 seed in the competitive Eastern Conference. However, when the playoff came around and the intensity was heightened, Randle didn’t look like himself. He couldn’t overpower people in the paint anymore, he didn’t create as much space to shoot his mid-range, and he didn’t shoot the ball well from anywhere on the court. Randle is a great player, but he’s not a top 15 NBA player yet - not even close - and it’s because of what he’s done (or hasn’t done) in the most important games that an NBA player can play. Playoff games. 

Note: When ranking the biggest playoff stock risers, I’m considering two main components: 

1) How much better the player performs in the playoffs as opposed to the regular season and 

2) How much more recognition a player gets during the playoffs as opposed to during the regular season (most often a result of a certain team not playing many nationally televised games or not playing in a big market, among other reasons).

5) Kevin Huerter

Kevin Huerter’s rise is definitely a testament in part to the 2nd ranking criteria; he plays in a small market (ATL) and is an unassuming, young player who was drafted in the same draft as Trae Young (and therefore has been overshadowed in the early part of his career). However, this man can flat out BALL, and it’s been a pleasure to watch him flourish in these playoffs. First of all, he’s 6 foot 7 and a good athlete. Yes, a good athlete. He gets super high on his jump shot, and it allows him to EASILY get shots up on shorter players, both out of the post and in the pick and roll; if you didn’t get a chance to watch ATL-PHI game 7, check out Huerter’s highlights from that game in which he absolutely exposes the Sixers (specifically Seth Curry) in the mid-range. He doesn’t just have the pull-up in his bag, though, he also has an underrated handle which allows him to get to multiple different spots on the court. We’ve seen him defended by some of the best defenders in the league during these playoffs (Jrue Holiday and Ben Simmons) and still be able to handle the rock under pressure and physicality. The ability to get to spots in the mid range and rise up to hit shots consistently is something that’s sustainable to build an offensive game around (we’ve seen guys like Beal, Booker, Durant, Middleton, and MANY OTHERS do it already), and Huerter is in an excellent position to do it as well, especially considering he’s only 22 years old. Huerter has also shown a solid ability to make plays for others. He has a high level understanding of offense and is always decisive and confident in his moves and passes, allowing him to be a secondary playmaker for the Hawks during this postseason. If you diligently watched the Hawks this postseason, you’ve probably seen a few of his cross court, lefty passes off the dribble. That’s high level stuff. Finally, Huerter plays on BOTH ENDS of the court! He’s shown some incredible fight while having to defend the likes of Tobias Harris, Ben Simmons, Jrue Holiday, Khris Middleton, and many other talented offensive players. He’s just a really good athlete with long arms who plays his butt off on that end and isn’t afraid to be physical and put his body on the line.  

4) Cameron Payne 

Cam Payne’s first claim to fame in the NBA was for his pregame dance routines with Russell Westbrook. Also, he was literally playing in China 2 years ago, and on multiple D-League teams before that, so it’s safe to say he definitely wasn’t on the average NBA fan’s radar prior to this postseason. He’s had an unbelievable turnaround, though, and he is about to get absolutely paid when he becomes a free agent next season. Payne has this special bounce in his step that I haven’t really seen before; he looks like he could be shot out of a cannon at any point and glide his way to the hoop. He’s also got a really nice floater game around the basket, and he can finish athletically with both hands and with control of his body at the rim. He pairs this with fantastic vision and a 6 foot 7 (!) wingspan, which makes him an unbelievable offensive threat. Before game 6 of the WCF (where CP3 assured all doubters that he is indeed the point God), there was a very persuasive case to be made that Cam Payne had been more effective than Chris Paul against LAC. This is because when CP3 was out of the lineup due to Covid, Payne took his game to a whole new level. We saw a confidence and comfortability that we hadn’t seen before with him, probably because he finally got the start and played big, important minutes. I had thought that maybe he would lose that bounce in his step over the course of a 48 minutes game if he was tasked with playing starting point guard minutes. Perhaps, I had thought, he was only that energetic because he comes in for 6 minute bursts. Well, I was dead wrong. Payne was as spry as he’s looked throughout these entire playoffs in games 1 and 2 of the WCF against LAC, and it has most definitely earned him a starting point guard spot in his near future, whether it be with Phoenix or another team. He’s going to get offered big money from an organization in free agency, much like Terry Rozier was offered a massive contract by the Hornets after his huge playoff performance with the Celtics in their 2018 playoff run to the conference finals. Payne has proven himself to be an impact player who deserves a firm spot in an NBA starting lineup, as well as a much larger contract than his current one (2 years, $2.1mil). The days of Cam Payne being “the guy who dances” are over, and he’s here to stay. He’ll be dancing ON the court from now on... 

3) Dillon Brooks

I must admit that I’m definitely considering the play-in games in conjunction with the playoff games when ranking these players, whether that’s logical or not. But guess what? I’m writing the article, so there’s unfortunately nothing you can do about it, unless you’d like to leave me a nasty comment at the bottom of this article. If Brooks and the Grizzlies had somehow found a way to surpass the Jazz, and Brooks had continued playing the way he was, there’s a very real possibility that Brooks would have been number one on this list. The Dillon Brooks that we saw in both the play-ins and the play-offs is a two way STUD that we didn’t have the pleasure of witnessing during the regular season nearly enough due to him playing in Memphis and therefore being overshadowed by both Ja and Jonas, not to mention playing in a small market. He’s got one of the better motors I’ve seen in the NBA, and it allows him to be a pest on defense like not many others can. He guards the best player on the other team in virtually every game MEM plays, and he WANTS IT, too. He loves the competition, he loves getting in your grill and making you miserable for 94 feet, and he loves being physical. In other words, his game (specifically on the defensive end) is tailor-made to the playoffs. On the offensive end, Brooks showed unbelievable strides in his skillset during the playoffs. He’s 6 foot 7 and 225 pounds, and he’s got a surprisingly polished offensive game. Like Huerter, he has a solid handle and can get to his spots in the mid-range and just rise up, which allows him to shoot over defenders with ease. He’s a lot stronger going to the hoop than Huerter, though, and he’s got a real knack for finishing around the rim with a number of different push-type shots with both hands. Finally, he can hit the three point shot, which forces defenses to guard him on the perimeter, therefore opening up room for Brooks to attack the paint. If Brooks continues his development on the offensive end, I really think he can turn into one of the best two-way players in the NBA. He averaged 25.8 points in this postseason against a very solid Jazz defense, and there’s no question he’s already one of the toughest perimeter defenders to go up against in the league. He’s only going to continue to improve, and he’s a name that you’re going to hear in the all-star conversation next year.

2) Trae Young

If you had any gripe with Trae Young being considered a superstar before the playoffs, you can no longer have that gripe. I mean, you can, you would just be very wrong. Trae Young has a few offensive qualities that, when paired together, make him virtually impossible to stop. The first thing he has is a great shooting touch from range; you can’t leave him with a step, or else he’ll get his three off quickly and will kill you. This forces defenses to pick him up basically as soon as he walks over halfcourt (much like Curry or Lillard), and it forces them to go over screens as well. The second thing that Trae possesses is an unbelievable first step - probably the best in basketball. His change of speed and ability to burst by the defense is second to none in the NBA, and when paired with his ability to shoot, it allows him to drive with incredible ease; he had the 3rd most drives per game in the entire NBA this season, which is pretty remarkable for a scrawny guy like Trae. Trae also has the best floater game in the NBA (by far). He takes and makes the most floaters in the league, and he doesn’t really need any space or time to get it off, which makes it quite lethal. He’s also the best lob thrower in the NBA; his lob (the majority of the time to either Capela or Collins) looks exactly like his floater, too, so it makes the Hawks virtually impossible to defend once Trae gets in the painted area. When Trae throws the ball in the air, the defense is afraid to block it (because if it’s a floater, it could be called for goaltending), and that oftentimes results in an easy dunk for one of the athletic ATL front court players. When combining these three qualities (shooting touch, quick first step, and lethal floater/lob game), it makes Trae dominant offensively. It doesn’t end there, though. Trae has that killer instinct, which I think many people were surprised by; people thought that once the pressure intensified as it does during the playoffs, Trae would have a hard time dealing with it. Instead, however, Trae used the defenses’ over-aggression to his advantage, blowing by the defense and either getting fouled or getting to his floater/lob game. He talked trash to opposing players, opposing fans, and literally anyone who was willing to listen to him. Against PHI, not only did he play against one of the meanest fanbases in the league, but he was defended primarily by Ben Simmons and Matisse Thybulle, two incredibly tough and physical PLAYOFF defenders. He wasn’t phased in the slightest, and it was unbelievably fun to watch. Trae put the entire ATL team on his back throughout the entire playoffs, and he’s proven that he must be considered a top 5 NBA point guard.

"nbadiscussion","TheOneTrueSunGod","How would you utilize Ben Simmons?","2021-28-06 9:00:44 AM","Ben Simmons is what he is at this point.  Could he develop a jumpshot before it’s all said and done? Maybe, crazier things have happened but t think it’s safe to say he won’t.   With that being said, I think his full potential has yet to be unlocked, but could be given the right circumstances. 

The Embiid and Simmons pairing isn’t working in the postseason because the two aren’t a great fit.  Embiid needs a guard that can spread the floor and give him the room to work s in down low, not one that has to sit in the dunkers spot for possessions at a time because he can’t shoot. And I personally believe that Simmons needs a rim roller type big to really thrive.  Simmons is one of the best passers and drivers in the game which both bode well for the P&R, look at what Harden and Trae young have been able to do with Capela, as well as what CP3 was able to do with guys like Deandre Jordan and Blake Griffin.  Now I know Harden Young and CP3 all poses the ability to shoot the ball coming off the screen and make floaters in the lane before getting to the rim, making their P&Rs less predictable but none of them are 6’10 and and are as intimidating as a full head of steam Simmons coming at the rim. 

Too dive deeper into screens, I think Simmons is one of if not the most interesting P&R men in the league.  He has the IQ, passing ability, and handle to be an excellent ball handler, but he also has the size, speed, and finishing ability to be just as good a roller.  Simmons has never played with another high level perimeter creator that can put him in the correct positions that beat suit his skill set. Look at lamelo and Miles Bridges, bridges efficiency has sky rocketed since Melo joined, and I believe that Simmons’ athleticism is comparable to that of bridges, so if you put another quality playmaker around him I think it would unlock a Simmons we have yet to see. 

My final point is that he is not a damn point guard!!!! I don’t care what anyone says he’s not a guard, he’s a big that can handle and pass the ball and that’s how he should play. If you play Simmons more at the Center position, it creates such a mismatch for the other teams , you either force the other team to go smaller to keep up with Ben and then you use his size as an advantage, and if they keep traditional centers on him he can take them off the dribble with ease. Playing 5 out also gives your offense to flow more freely if done correctly.","t3_o9n8eh","https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/o9n8eh/how_would_you_utilize_ben_simmons/",30,33,"t1_h3ifee8","2021-29-06 6:44:54 PM","Guard the other teams best player and play a secondary/tertiary playmaker role from inside on offense.

The narrative around Paul’s playoff run has been interesting. He came from developing young guys in OKC last year and teamed up with Booker and really brought the Suns together, seemingly stepping into a leader and talent developing position again.

So to discuss, do you think the Suns can win game 2 again without Chris Paul? Given we know kawhi will be out again, does anything about their strategy change if Paul is again out? 

How much impact has Paul had on bringing Suns team together over the past year?

They are the better team with Chris and Kawhi out and most likely better with both of them healthy as well. They move the ball better than any team in the league and their young guys have developed perfectly into their roles. Chris demands a very high level of expectation and is an extremely clutch, consistent and smart player but even when he’s not on the court his effect is felt. They play with the same confidence, Cam Payne has had a career resurgence and been great, Mikal and Ayton are playing their roles at an elite level and others are contributing in spurts. When Chris plays the biggest benefit is his decision making in the clutch and that he doesn’t turn the ball over. Yes he’s been unlucky over the years with his own injuries and his teammates. He’s an all time great player and If he’s healthy the suns are the favorites to win the championship imo.",2,0,0.707,0.293,0.9961,4.43
"nbadiscussion","Diamond4Hands4Ever","Kawhi to the Hawks in FA?","2021-27-06 4:14:10 PM","If Kawhi decides to test the market in Free Agency this summer, I think the Hawks should definitely be on his radar. Here are some reasons why.

1. The Hawks don’t have to give up too much to get him. As it stands now, in order to clear enough cap space to give him the max (~$39.35 mil.), the Hawks would only have to renounce all their cap holds (including John Collins’), and dump the salaries of Gallo, Kris Dunn, and Bruno Fernando; sending those contracts and a 2nd-rounder or two to OKC probably does the job. 

That isn’t nothing — Gallo and John Collins are good players — but that doesn’t compare to Kawhi’s value, and the Hawks get to keep their young wings (Reddish, Huerter, and Hunter) and their 1st for this year.


2. The Hawks have the pieces to build a contender right now. As is, the Hawks’ core of Young, Hunter, Bogdanovic, Huerter, Capela, and Reddish are already pretty good, and have proven that the playoffs aren’t too big for them. Adding Leonard makes the Hawks true title contenders, and that’s before them rounding out their roster with vet Free Agents using their MLE and BAE. The Hawks could realistically field a lineup of

PG: Young
SG: Bogdanovic
SF: Hunter
PF: Leonard
C:  Capela 

with a second unit of 

PG: Ish Smith
SG: Huerter
SF: Reddish
PF: Bobby Portis
C: Okongwu / Vet Min. Big

That team is deep, versatile, and well-rounded: a good mix for playoff basketball. Note also that Nate McMillan seems perfectly capable as a coach and should be the Hawks HC long-term, which is a plus.


3. The Hawks have the flexibility to trade for a disgruntled star next year, and that could truly make them special. Unlike most other teams contending for titles, the Hawks have good young players on cheap contracts for next year, and have all of their draft picks. 

If a star like Bradley Beal or Zach Lavine demands a trade, the Atlanta Hawks can outbid other teams in order to acquire them via trade. They could really sweeten the pot with multiple young players, numerous first round picks, and an established vet while still being a title contender worthy of a star player’s respect and time. 

That’s something that the Clippers and many other contenders can’t do, which makes them significantly less capable of improving their rosters substantially. This is what makes the Hawks uniquely good as a free agent landing spot. Adding a third star to Trae Young and Kawhi Leonard in 2022 would be entirely possible and would make the Hawks a true force in the NBA for years to come.


Ultimately, I don’t think this will happen at all, but the Hawks have a lot to offer for Kawhi and would be a good destination for him. What do y’all think?

|Games|Career PPG|Career Points|
|:-|:-|:-|
|1207|23.7|28,596|

&#x200B;

From the 1993 to 2005 Season, Shaq averaged 67 games per Season. **For the first scenario I will do the following:**

1. In the final six Seasons of his career, I’m going to continue to use 67 games each year.
2. Instead of using his points per game as they were, I’m instead going to take a different approach, and decrease his ppg by 1.5ppg each successive Season.

**Scenario One:**

|Season|Age|Games|Career Games|PPG|Career PPG|Points|Career Points|Notes|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Till 2005|20 - 32||882||26.7||23,583||
|2006|33|67|949|21.4|26.4|1454|25,037||
|2007|34|67|1016|19.9|25.9|1333|26,370||
|2008|35|67|1083|18.4|25.5|1233|27,603||

|2011|38|67|1284|13.9|23.9|931|30,701||

&#x200B;

**Now I’m going to assume Shaq:**

1. Ends up playing 20 Seasons instead of 19.
2. Plays 70 games per Season for his remaining seven Seasons (after 2005).
3. Decreased his ppg by 1ppg each year instead of 1.5.

**Scenario Two:**

|Season|Age|Games|Career Games|PPG|Career PPG|Points|Career Points|Notes|

|2009|36|70|1162|18.9|25.2|1323|29,295|**Surpassed total career points.**|
|2010|37|70|1232|17.9|24.8|1253|30,548||

|2012|39|70|1372|15.9|23.9|1113|32,844|**Would be third leading scorer of all time in 2012, surpassing Michael Jordan.**|

How do I 'quantify' that surprise?


One way you could do it is to look at Adj Net Rating, but that's not telling me the story I expected

Net Rating of the 2020/2021 Suns - 5.74

Net Rating of the 2020/2021 Hawks - 2.19

I looked into adj net rating of recent champions:

2020 Lakers - 6.16

2019 Raps - 5.38

2018 Ws - 5.70

2017 Ws - 11.41

2016 Cavs - 5.90

2015 Ws - 10.23

2014 Spurs - 8.45

2013 Heat - 7.75

2012 Heat - 6.26

2011 Mavs - 4.68

2010 Lakers - 5.00

One person said that defense is better now than it was in the 90s and the reason for this is because offense is way better while defense has improved only slightly. I personally believe that this is wrong due to a few reasons. Let me know what you guys think

1. There are way more shooters that can space the floor that gives stars a chance to go 1 on 1 and see the whole floor more easily.

2. Rule changes for handchecking and illegal screens make it easier for offensive players to create space.

3. There are less elite rim protectors than in the 90s. Hakeem averaged like 4 or 5 blocks a game for a season. 

4. Zone defense is overrated and can only be used to stop a simple offensive attack or an offense that relies on a single player.

Edit: I’m the rule changes I forgot to mention how many fouls jump shooters get nowadays and the general inconsistency of the refs.","t3_ogjfv2","https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/ogjfv2/why_defense_was_better_in_the_90s/",0,18,"t1_h4mjqam","2021-09-07 12:42:00 PM","I fully agree with #3, but the overall quality of defense, both man to man, and on help schemes, is much more advanced.  Players are more physically and mentally engaged on defense overall.  If you watch 90s games for close-outs, helps, stunt-helps, and defensive adjustments, the differences between now and the 90s are very significant.  In a lot of games played by genuinely good teams, you will see several guys who look like they just don't know how to play defense. &#x200B; Also, refs are much better now than they were in the 90s. However, our much higher expectations of them, and the scrutiny they receive from extremely precise recordings, make their mistakes more egregious.",2,0.023,0.684,0.293,0.9875,4.43
"nbadiscussion","acacia-club-road","Who are the top ten players remaining in the 2021 Playoffs?","2021-24-06 9:22:44 PM","For me, I’ve got

1) Giannis Antetokounmpo: Yes, his flaws are becoming more and more magnified as each game passes, but he still more than makes up for it by being an absolute defensive monster and bailing out the Bucks more often than not on the other side of the floor.  

2) Paul George: Dynamic two-way player that has nearly no weakness in his offensive bag; the fatigue is starting to show here and there, but overall, “Playoff P” is demonstrating the will to win as much as any other star is right now, and he’s backing it up, too. 

3) Trae Young: Wow. Just wow. Tempted to put him at 2 or 1, but I’m just waiting to see where and when the magic stops. Unless it doesn’t. Which might be the case. 

4) Chris Paul: When healthy, he paces the Suns to victory with ruthless efficiency and has the savvy to exceed the defensive liabilities his stature presents. Probably the sweetest midrange jumper on this list. Well, maybe save for….

5) Devin Booker: Can get hotter than anyone on this list with the exception of Trae. Starting to really put it all together, but the sum of all of Booker’s parts still just might not be enough for him to get on this list’s Mt. Rushmore spots. 

6) Jrue Holiday: I have a thing for two-way players. A defensive ace, though one with a bad habit of getting smoked by Trae Young. His playmaking is also more controlled, although less dynamic than his Philly days. Jrue has really improved his shooting, too. 

7) DeAndre Ayton: Showing lots of maturity…and some immaturity. A ruthlessly efficient big that can do it both ends…just can’t do it BIG TIME over a large period of time…yet.

8) Khris Middleton: Great on-and-off offensive threat that plays great team D and makes few mistakes. Unfortunately not as polished of a playmaker as you’d want from the de facto second option on a thin Bucks roster full of spot up only guys. Also has a knack for stinking it up about as often as he is a last second clutch killa. 

9) Rajon Rondo: yes. rondo. He doesn’t play a lot, his defense is the furthest thing from being a sight for sore eyes, and his athleticism has waned exponentially. Even still, he adds just that element of surprise and we all know that if Playoff Rondo shows up one of these games, Phoenix (or whoever is coming out of the East) is surely fucked. 

10) John Collins: A very versatile big with numerous athletic advantages that manages to package them into a sadly-mismatched assemblage of unidimensional “meh”s on the floor. Shot needs work, defensive timing is okay, and playmaking is nonexistent. Still, his potential is enough to get one salivating.","t3_o7ganw","https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/o7ganw/who_are_the_top_ten_players_remaining_in_the_2021/",0,10,"t1_h32ztlf","2021-25-06 11:41:19 PM","1.Giannis 2.PG13 3.Trae 4.CP3 5.Booker 6.Jrue 7.Middleton 8.Ayton 9.John Collins 10.Reggie Jackson Starting centers for each team - Ayton, Lopez, Ayton and Capela.

"nbadiscussion","Chickensandcoke","NBA needs to start marketing its gameplay rather than debates and hypotheticals","2021-08-07 1:49:06 PM","Seeing comments around r/NBA and in basketball subreddits in general, give off the consensus of people being tired of the NBA promoting player drama and debates rather than the on-court product. If you look at the NFL, the majority of the networks and programs talk about the analysis of games. 

For example, how a defensive scheme won them certain possessions, what kind of route combinations the offensive coordinator drew up that week, how a QB managed to scramble and create a play on the fly.

I feel like I don't see any real basketball analysis on the popular networks and programs. I would love it if networks went into how the Suns' offense is being run through Chris Paul with Ayton and Booker, or how the Bucks should run their defense while Giannis is on the court.

I think teaching more basketball knowledge would cater to the existing fans more and provide insights to newer fans. I understand that the flashy plays and big names bring in the revenue, but this is an untapped market that I think will improve the health and interest of the game.

Edit: Omg so many comments! One thing I noticed was people saying that basketball is a faster pace than football so they can’t say as much during the game.

"nbadiscussion","lukadirkfan","Evaluating Ty Lue as a coach","2021-29-06 10:05:02 AM","There has been widespread appreciation for Ty Lue as a coach as the plucky Clippers have been fighting their way back into 3 consecutive series now. Heres my assessment of his coaching and would love to get other people's opinion on it too.

I'll start with the positives...

His players seem to love playing for him. They play with energy and new guys coming into the rotation seem engaged and prepared to play even if they havent been getting minutes previously.

Not afraid to make changes and adapt (eventually) and maintains calm demeanor even when under pressure.

Young players and players previously on the fringe like Mann and Jackson have become steady contributors. So good development/maximization of available talent (maybe good staff related).
 
However, there have been certain issues I feel which seem to have been masked by the deep roster and the subsequent success they've had so far and to an extent the injury to Kawhi. His insistence on playing Rondo has been a glaring one where in each series Clippers have fallen behind losing multiple close games at the start. Rondo minutes have largely been detrimental to the Clippers. 

His in-game tactics have been sub-optimal at times as well. Leaving Kennard in at the end of game 2 against the Jazz where he was relentlessly and successfully hunted by Mitchell while not even attempting a shot at the offensive end as Clippers went ISO heavy with their stars. Another example was putting out a completely non-shooting lineup after a dead ball situation with <5 seconds left to end the 3rd qtr. in the same game IIRC.

Decided to play Zubac extended minutes in game 4 against the Suns and once the outside shots werent falling, there didnt seem to be a plan B with the lane clogged. In the minutes they went small, they decided to play conventional defense instead of switching.

One explanation for the lineups and rotations has been that guys like Rondo and Boogie have acted as innings eaters, taking some minutes off the main players as they have played extended series and condensed schedule. However, there are two problems with that: One, instead of Rondo and Cousins, those minutes shouldve gone to guys like Mann and Batum who have been effective but have been underplayed at various points in the playoffs. Mann, moreso before his breakout performace against the Jazz. Two, had the Clippers not made these errors on the margins in close losses, its conceivable they could've wrapped up their series earlier and thus saving themselves from extra games and condensed schedule.

Some of these foibles have been papered over I believe  because they have the deepest roster in the league with 6-7 guys shooting~40% from 3, some of whom are excellent defenders as well. Multiple playmakers and shot makers in Jackson, George and Leonard, latter two being elite wing defenders as well and serviceable big men. 

Overall, I think I would rate him as a good to very good coach, definitely belonging in the top half/third of the league and the value over someone like Doc Rivers is substantial.","t3_oaciqc","https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/oaciqc/evaluating_ty_lue_as_a_coach/",7,4,"t1_h3h91ea","2021-29-06 1:08:51 PM","He’s only coached two teams and both had top superstar players with deep rosters. We saw once the team in Cleveland got younger, he struggled and got canned quickly. So it’s hard to evaluate him too much because I think he’s a beneficiary of coaching talented teams.  The glaring positives though are his belief and confidence instilled in role players and his willingness to adjust. Lue was a role player, so you can tell he values those guys as well. Guys like Reggie, Pat, Morris, Mann, and Kennard are playing meaningful minutes and Lue believes in them and gives them opportunities to contribute. It’s not like Rivers where he focused mainly on his stars and was stubborn about adjusting or doing something different. I feel like that’s something Ty picked up from Phil Jackson. He manages all sorts of personalities well and gets the most out of everyone he can.  To me, he’s a top 10 coach currently in the league. He shows a willingness to adjust and he seems to be well-versed on what to do at certain times. Plus he knows how to motivate stars and role players. That’s important in the NBA. I still am unsure he could coach any team in the league to success, for example the Kings or Magic, or someone younger. But he’s a good Phil Jackson type that knows how to manage talented teams.",8,0.041,0.73,0.229,0.9924,7.29
"nbadiscussion","ShampooMonK","8 observations from this post-season.","2021-24-06 11:23:22 AM","1. Big Ball vs Small Ball centers
   1. One of things that was interesting was how in 2020, it was a season of small ball centers taking center stage. Bam Adebayo helped sink the Celtics. Anthony Davis was a defensive force. The Rockets bet the farm on PJ Tucker. All these dudes, outside Davis, were legit small for the center, while Davis is skinny. All of them had some level of success.
   2. In 2021 though, arguably what we're seeing is the rise of Big ball centers -- guys with some offensive skills but whose role is really to play D and PLAY BIG. Three of the four teams left count on guys who are Big Ball centers -- Ayton, whose a mobile 7 footer and the talk of the playoffs, Lopez, a sweet shooting big man who can box out and defend well, and Clint Capela, whose as close to a poor man's clone of Dwight Howard as any in the league. This is a big difference than from last year. I'm defining the big ball center by what they do on D not O, btw. 
2. Superstar/Hybrid Centers have done well this playoffs, but if you ask them to do too much on offense, you didn't get out of the second round
   1. The common thread of KD, Embiid and Jokic. KD saw his teammates go down and him step up to play big and score, setting up the offense. He did amazing. It wasn't enough, eliminated. Embiid had to also be the last line of defense, play big and set up his offense. It was too much, eliminated. Jokic saw his teammates go down, play big and set up his offense. MVP of the regular season, but that's too much, eliminated. If you compare this to Giannis, whose job was to play D reasonably well while also leading the offense, but not be the entirety of the defense at the rim and doing defensive rebounding, you see why he's still standing. It's going to be a while before we see a Shaq in 2000 performance ever again, something that should make us appreciate that ALOT more. 
3. Rudy Gobert took the heat for Utah losing, but the reality is is that injuries caught up to the team's guards. 
   1. We all just like to make fun of him and it's okay, he should gain a thicker skin. This one's been done ad nauseam. Just remember -- to lose a 26 point lead, both your defense and offense must fail, and considering Reggie Jackson and Terrance Mann suddenly went super saiyan, from all over the court, while Don Mitchell just couldn't score anymore, I put that lost squarely on the guards of the team, and then on Rudy. Wouldn't be shocked if their injuries are worse than we think.
4. The Suns are a young team but play like an old team, they don't turn the ball over that much and that will likely be a big reason they beat the Clippers, if they beat the Clippers.
   1. When I predicted the Lakers to go over the Suns in the first round, I was relying on old logic -- young teams don't win, even in wacky seasons. Well, that's because young teams have a tendency to self combust, turning the ball over under pressure, not knowing who should shoot on the last play, having some chemistry issues, etc. That and the Lakers thrived off teams turning the ball over last season, turning Russell Westbrook's dribbling into a liability, something that led to transition and then AD putting the other team in foul trouble. Well... I was wrong! The Suns have legit none of those issues of young teams and are pretty careful with the basketball! One wonders if this due to CP3 being a basketball wizard and changing his approach with age and playing on that OKC team last season. I genuinely believe this is the net effect of CP3, he's one of those beyond the box score leader types. 
5. Injuries had a big effect, but so do role players stepping up.
   1. People will write about this 1000x here so I'm not going to add anything. Have at it.
6. Ben Simmons scraped by on potential and now that's simply not good enough.
   1. 10 years ago, Ben Simmons would've played like Rajon Rondo, and would have been expected to have similar levels of success to Rondo. This legit wasn't that long ago, Rondo was phenomenal for a while and the league isn't fully in ""everyone must shoot"" mode until the Warriors first chip, though teams were experimenting. We still have players that are relics of that era, though increasingly, they're less effective. 
   2. As his season is now over, it's time to assess Ben Simmons and the role of ""non shooting, defense first point guards."" One surmises that a point guard who can't shoot, can't effectively do his job despite being 6'10, because the defense sags back in the playoffs. This isn't so much an issue if you're going to be running at the basket all the time in transition. The thing with playoff ball is that, transition opportunities get limited by teams suddenly playing much more carefully with the ball.
   3. This then begs the question, are we simply miscasting Ben Simmons as a point guard now? Is he ACTUALLY a point guard or is he... a point forward or small ball 5? I think this is the major question surrounding Simmons, which is A) what is he and B) how much should he be enabled by teams (the Westbrook question). It doesn't take a genius to see he's probably needing a rethinking of what he can do by someone. 
7. Trae Young, Kawhi Leonard, Luka Doncic, Kevin Durant, Donovan Mitchell, Devin Booker are keeping Kobe's memory alive even better than the 2020 Lakers did, by shooting from the midrange so effectively. 
   1. Arguably, this should be the least shocking thing about the playoffs -- when the clock ticks down and the balls in the superstars hands, their job is to make silly, ridiculous shots, like Kobe did, like Wade did, like Jordan did, etc. The midrange is the superstars shot, it's the shot they get paid for, and I just listed 6 guys who having that midrange in the game is probably lifting them past their peers. 
8. The Hawks vs Bucks is a major question of winning in the NBA -- is defense or offense more important? 
   1. The Hawks are a better offensive team that is an okay defensive team. Capela helps. But you know, their best defense is shooting and making shots, kinda like the old Rockets were.
   2. The Bucks are a staunch SLOW IT DOWN AND TRY TO SCORE ON US defensive team, with some shooters to keep the game close if the other team is scoring a lot or make the game get out of hand if the opponent can't score at all. They have four good defenders in the starting lineup, and in a way, somewhat resemble the 2020 Lakers, only Middleton is in the AD free safety role.
   3. I don't know who would win, my prediction even after game 1 is this is a knockdown dragout series, but there's legit two philosophies on the floor, and if the Bucks win it would match my perception that BAD ASS D wins titles. But they also could not win. I don't know. 
9. The teams left standing all have a combination of young guys and veterans, affirming what I, a know nothing fan, have always believed in was the championship formula.
   1. Whether its the Hawks with Gallinari, Bucks with Jrue, Clippers with Reggie Jackson, or the Suns with CP3, the impact of guys with 10 plus year careers in the league can often be felt in that even if they're bad, they provide some steadiness in the playoffs. Arguably these guys have bigger roles than they had, getting their big contracts, outside Reggie Jackson. Always important to note is whose got a team built like this, IMO.","t3_o76t0q","https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/o76t0q/8_observations_from_this_postseason/",9,4,"t1_h2x1lha","2021-24-06 12:07:52 PM",">Big Ball vs Small Ball centers   >   >One of things that was interesting was how in 2020, it was a season of small ball centers taking center stage.  The Rockets bet the farm on PJ Tucker. Rockets didn't bet the farm on **PJ Tucker,** they had no choice. Rockets made the mistake of trading for Westbrook. Now, they were forced to be committed to the micro-ball route and traded for RoCo and trotted out a small ball lineup that featured PJ Tucker, (who ALSO was DISGRUNTLED already for not being given a contract extension and for playing through a pinched nerve at center while standing a buck 6'5,) at the 5. I never understood why they were convinced that the micro ball of relying on a lot of shooters that didn't well shoot at all was going to work... RoCo had a terrible shooting year at 31.5%, Eric Gordon shot 31.7%. You really need some positive production rather than mass inefficient volume 3 point shooting. Honestly, I think the Rockets made a mistake trading away Capela. I never understood why they were so quick to get rid of him, getting rid of your best rebounder, shot blocker, and under 26 locked up for next 3 years. But Westbrook/Harden killed their spacing and rendered Capela useless. \_\_\_ >Bam Adebayo helped sink the Celtics. Bam Adebayo was *a beast against the Celtics,* but we were also featuring Daniel Theis at 6'8, who's also a small ball center himself. The refs also seemed to love calling fouls on Theis, and we had terrible depth. Honestly, I'm not going to make excuses, but I think we had a better team on paper, but failed to execute. Credit to to Miami for doing their job. &#x200B; >Anthony Davis was a defensive force. Who still shouldn't be playing the 5, although that's his ideal position in the modern NBA. The problem is his inability to stay healthy plus being banged up against the bigger bulkier 5's is not a good plan for his health moving forward. That's why the Lakers have been intent in getting someone like a Drummond or Gasol to spell him at those minutes. >In 2021 though, arguably what we're seeing is the rise of Big ball centers -- guys with some offensive skills but whose role is really to play D and PLAY BIG.

This is a big difference than from last year. I'm defining the big ball center by what they do on D not O, btw. Yeah, but a lot of these bigs all benefit greatly from a team that has a solid PnR partner in Trae Young/CP3/Booker. I will say Lopez is different, because he has changed his shot profile to help space the floor. &#x200B; >Superstar/Hybrid Centers have done well this playoffs, but if you ask them to do too much on offense, you didn't get out of the second round There's a common trend in these superstar centers not making it out of the second round, and **that can be attributed to missing their 2nd options or lack of one,** (Simmons, Murray, Irving/Harden.) Irving/Harden were in and out, and Harris/Aaron Gordon/Tobias Harris all played below their expectations. Your role players and 2nd stars need to show up to win. There's just too many talented teams that have plenty of depth and pieces to make it a tough series. (Hawks/Suns.) &#x200B; >Rudy Gobert took the heat for Utah losing, but the reality is is that injuries caught up to the team's guards.   >   >We all just like to make fun of him and it's okay, he should gain a thicker skin.

Wouldn't be shocked if their injuries are worse than we think. Gobert can't solve the Jazz's weak perimeter defenders constantly giving up corner 3's, he defended pretty well. Terance Man just went ham, tip your hat off to him. When Gobert's forced to switch out and you're taking away and negating his shot blocking abilities, but you cannot also be happy with how passive at times, Gobert was whenever there was a smaller defender on him. Gobert is getting paid $40 million, he needs to learn maybe some basic post moves. Ayton, being switched on Morris would've been a field day for him. &#x200B; >The Suns are a young team but play like an old team, they don't turn the ball over that much and that will likely be a big reason they beat the Clippers, if they beat the Clippers.   >   >When I predicted the Lakers to go over the Suns in the first round, I was relying on old logic -- young teams don't win, even in wacky seasons.

I think it's also a given at this point that players like Jae Crowder or CP3 help change the culture of the team. They are great leaders or role players that you can fit on any team.  It's no coincidence that Crowder or Trevor Ariza's been such a journeymen. Plenty of teams value dogs.",3,0.098,0.765,0.137,0.9941,3.37
"nbadiscussion","Naismythology","If the Suns and Hawks “Don’t Belong”, do the 2020 Lakers “belong”?","2021-01-07 9:16:41 PM","For those who say the Suns and Hawks don’t belong or haven’t proved themselves, does the same go for the 2020 Lakers? 

I personally think the argument against any of these teams is invalid, as making a competitive conference finals validates you itself IMO. But, I would like to pose this as a discussion. I think the playoff paths of the Suns, Hawks, and 2020 Lakers are all relatively similar, so if you were to say one doesn’t belong, i think you would need to say they all don’t belong. Let’s break it down:

Round 1:

3 points -> Suns: 4-2 over Lakers

- Lebron just back from injury, AD misses 2.5 games, CP3 injures his shoulder, has limited minutes, and can barely shoot. Suns easily handle the hobbled defending champs in 6

2 points -> Lakers: 4-1 over Portland 

- Dame misses game 5, CJ plays with a broken back, and the Lakers handedly take care of a team that barely snuck into the playoffs

1 point -> Hawks: 4-1 over the Knicks

- Hawks easily take care of a feel good first-time playoff team in 5

I think the advantage here goes to the Suns, with the Lakers and Hawks about even, but I’ll give the Lakers the edge since the Blazers have more star power and experience.

Round 2:

3 points -> Lakers 4-1 over Houston

- Russ has a very poor series after returning from both Covid and an injury that kept him mostly out of round 1. The Rockets also miss one of their key pieces in Danuel House after game 2. After some early close games, the Lakers easily handle Harden and the Rockets.

2 points -> Hawks 4-3 over Philadelphia 

- Playing without a starter in Hunter, the Hawks take down the #1 seed in the 76ers who are missing Danny Green. Yes, it’s a long, tight series, but this is a solid win over a good team with a great player.

1 point -> Suns: 4-0 over Denver

- Suns sweep an outclassed Denver team missing their second best player in Jamal Murray. CP3 has an incredible series, Ayton (kinda) slows down the MVP. 

I’d say the Lakers had the toughest series here, but I think the Hawks are close. I really think the 76ers were a very, very good team, but so were the Rockets and the Lakers handled their business better. The Nuggets had finals potential with Murray healthy.

Round 3: 

3 points -> Suns 4-2 over Clippers

- Yes, the Clippers were missing Kawhi, Ibaka, and Zubac, but this team was GOOD. They beat the #1 seed Jazz btb mostly without those guys (Zubac played some). The Clippers battled hard and definitely could have won the series, but keep in mind that the Suns took 2 games without their MVP-vote-getter in CP3, that’s huge. 

2 points -> Lakers 4-1 over Denver

- Solid win for the Lakers here. Many people felt Denver was similar to how they feel about the Hawks this year, giving them no chance to win. But, this Denver team was resilient and very good, and beat two good teams in the Jazz and Clippers. Solid win for the Lakers.

1 point -> Hawks 4-3 over Bucks (if it happens)

- if the Hawks can come back and win the series, it will be another win against an elite team. Yes, they were down 2-1, but YES they were up 15 without Trae against a mostly healthy Bucks team in game 4 (Divencenzo I remember you). If Giannis doesn’t return, being almost tied 2-2 with a btb MVP and the consensus #2 team in the East is no slouch.

Here I give the edge to the Suns, but it’s really another toss up between them and the Lakers. The Hawks are a close 3rd.

After 3 rounds, the Suns and Lakers are tied at #1 with 7. The Hawks have 4. With that being said, I think a Hawks finals win over a healthy Suns would be valued more than the Lakers win over the Heat, who were missing both Bam and Dragic for much of the series. If the Suns beat the Bucks with Giannis, that would be the most impressive win for sure. Beating the Hawks or the Bucks without Giannis would be similar to the Lakers win.

tldr; I don’t think there is much difference between the playoff paths of the Suns and Hawks this year, or the Lakers last season. Whichever team wins the finals, they PROVED THEMSELVES. If you believe that this season’s teams do not belong, I would like to hear your case for the 2020 Lakers alongside your case against these teams.","t3_oc2khi","https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/oc2khi/if_the_suns_and_hawks_dont_belong_do_the_2020/",0,12,"t1_h3tj3nw","2021-02-07 9:12:47 AM","Assuming the Suns would lose to any/all of the teams they played at full strength is weird.

- Suns sweep an outclassed Denver team missing their second best player in Jamal Murray. CP3 has an incredible series, Ayton (kinda) slows down the MVP. 

I’d say the Lakers had the toughest series here, but I think the Hawks are close. I really think the 76ers were a very, very good team, but so were the Rockets and the Lakers handled their business better. The Nuggets had finals potential with Murray healthy.

Round 3: 

3 points -> Suns 4-2 over Clippers

- Yes, the Clippers were missing Kawhi, Ibaka, and Zubac, but this team was GOOD. They beat the #1 seed Jazz btb mostly without those guys (Zubac played some). The Clippers battled hard and definitely could have won the series, but keep in mind that the Suns took 2 games without their MVP-vote-getter in CP3, that’s huge. 

2 points -> Lakers 4-1 over Denver

- Solid win for the Lakers here. Many people felt Denver was similar to how they feel about the Hawks this year, giving them no chance to win. But, this Denver team was resilient and very good, and beat two good teams in the Jazz and Clippers. Solid win for the Lakers.

1 point -> Hawks 4-3 over Bucks (if it happens)

- if the Hawks can come back and win the series, it will be another win against an elite team. Yes, they were down 2-1, but YES they were up 15 without Trae against a mostly healthy Bucks team in game 4 (Divencenzo I remember you). If Giannis doesn’t return, being almost tied 2-2 with a btb MVP and the consensus #2 team in the East is no slouch.

Here I give the edge to the Suns, but it’s really another toss up between them and the Lakers. The Hawks are a close 3rd.

After 3 rounds, the Suns and Lakers are tied at #1 with 7. The Hawks have 4. With that being said, I think a Hawks finals win over a healthy Suns would be valued more than the Lakers win over the Heat, who were missing both Bam and Dragic for much of the series. If the Suns beat the Bucks with Giannis, that would be the most impressive win for sure. Beating the Hawks or the Bucks without Giannis would be similar to the Lakers win.

tldr; I don’t think there is much difference between the playoff paths of the Suns and Hawks this year, or the Lakers last season. Whichever team wins the finals, they PROVED THEMSELVES. If you believe that this season’s teams do not belong, I would like to hear your case for the 2020 Lakers alongside your case against these teams.","t3_oc2khi","https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/oc2khi/if_the_suns_and_hawks_dont_belong_do_the_2020/",0,12,"t1_h3rw6us","2021-01-07 11:04:03 PM","You could really looked at Lakers 2020 run and say they did not beat any great team, but there is Denver that was there with Jamal Murray.

"nbadiscussion","iamadragan","If the Suns and Hawks “Don’t Belong”, do the 2020 Lakers “belong”?","2021-01-07 9:16:41 PM","For those who say the Suns and Hawks don’t belong or haven’t proved themselves, does the same go for the 2020 Lakers? 

I personally think the argument against any of these teams is invalid, as making a competitive conference finals validates you itself IMO. But, I would like to pose this as a discussion. I think the playoff paths of the Suns, Hawks, and 2020 Lakers are all relatively similar, so if you were to say one doesn’t belong, i think you would need to say they all don’t belong. Let’s break it down:

Round 1:

3 points -> Suns: 4-2 over Lakers

- Lebron just back from injury, AD misses 2.5 games, CP3 injures his shoulder, has limited minutes, and can barely shoot. Suns easily handle the hobbled defending champs in 6

2 points -> Lakers: 4-1 over Portland 

- Dame misses game 5, CJ plays with a broken back, and the Lakers handedly take care of a team that barely snuck into the playoffs

1 point -> Hawks: 4-1 over the Knicks

- Hawks easily take care of a feel good first-time playoff team in 5

I think the advantage here goes to the Suns, with the Lakers and Hawks about even, but I’ll give the Lakers the edge since the Blazers have more star power and experience.

Round 2:

3 points -> Lakers 4-1 over Houston

- Russ has a very poor series after returning from both Covid and an injury that kept him mostly out of round 1. The Rockets also miss one of their key pieces in Danuel House after game 2. After some early close games, the Lakers easily handle Harden and the Rockets.

2 points -> Hawks 4-3 over Philadelphia 

- Playing without a starter in Hunter, the Hawks take down the #1 seed in the 76ers who are missing Danny Green. Yes, it’s a long, tight series, but this is a solid win over a good team with a great player.

1 point -> Suns: 4-0 over Denver

- Suns sweep an outclassed Denver team missing their second best player in Jamal Murray. CP3 has an incredible series, Ayton (kinda) slows down the MVP.

"nbadiscussion","cherryripeswhore","[OC] I went through every NBA awards ballot from this season to rank voters by how unique (or contrarian) their votes were","2021-23-06 7:27:10 AM","Any ole yokel can take a screenshot of an awards ballot and dunk on an unsuspecting media member. But i hold myself to a marginally higher standard. So over the last few days, I combed through [every NBA awards ballot](https://pr.nba.com/voting-results-2020-21-nba-regular-season-awards/) to mathematically rank media members by how far their votes deviated from the consensus.

The math that goes into the formula for ranking voters is straight forward, but extremely dull. In short, I calculated how many standard deviations each voter’s ballot is from the consensus ballot. If you’re interested in reading the full methodology, [I'd recommend checking the footnotes at this link.](https://thef5.substack.com/p/au-contraire)

But before I go any further, I want to emphasize that a voter going against the grain is not necessarily a bad thing. In fact, [I have long argued that awards voters are becoming too similar and it’s leading to boring and predictable results.](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/mvp-voting-has-never-been-more-boring/)

Still, it’s fun to look at which voters are marching to the beat of their own drum and which ones are falling in line with everyone else. But again, to reiterate, this post is not meant to mock, laugh at, or criticize anyone. I’m just sorting media members by the uniqueness of their voting behavior in a systematic way to see what pops out.

So now that we’ve avoided any defamation lawsuits, here are the voters ranked by how contrarian their awards ballots are. The further to the right a voter’s ballot is on the chart, the more unusual it is relative to the consensus. Meanwhile, the further to the left a voter’s ballot is, the closer it mirrors the theoretical average voter.

https://imgur.com/IedEWyM

The big takeaway here is that Max Haupt, a first-time voter (and probably last-time voter — more on that in a moment) covering the NBA for Deutsche Presse-Agentur, has by far the most unique collection of ballots out of any awards voter. His MVP, Coach of the Year, and All-Defensive Team ballots are each two or more standard deviations away from the consensus.

That number by itself doesn’t carry much meaning, so let’s look into the specifics behind why these values shake out the way they do.

A voter’s ballot is comprised of individual votes and the colored column in the table below details how contrarian each of Haupt’s individual votes are. Those numbers represent the squared difference between the amount of points Haupt awarded to a particular player or coach and the amount of points the average voter awarded to that player or coach. The bigger the difference, the more contrarian the vote.

https://imgur.com/zRPFibl

Ultimately, Haupt’s MVP ballot is what pushed him so far out to right on the contrarian scale. To begin, he gave Luka Doncic a second-place vote when no one else gave him anything higher than a fourth-place vote. Additionally, he was one of only five voters to give Stephen Curry a first-place vote and the only voter to omit Nikola Jokic entirely from his MVP ballot. Instead of putting Jokic on his MVP ballot, Haupt made the objectively unique choice of giving Russell Westbrook and Ben Simmons a third- and fourth-place MVP vote, respectively.

Meanwhile, Haupt’s Coach of the Year ballot wasn’t unreasonable, but it was contrarian in part because he left the eventual winner (Tom Thibodeau) off his ballot entirely.

Furthermore, he was the only voter that voted for Marcus Smart for 1st Team All-Defense. Also, he included his fellow countrymen Daniel Theis and Dennis Schröder on his 2nd Team All-Defense ballot, which earned him a few additional contrarian points.

Compare Haupt’s ballot to a voter who is more in line with the consensus, like ESPN’s Rachel Nichols. Overall, Nichols had a fairly uncontroversial ballot with the only real contrarian choice coming from her Most Improved Player ballot, which featured Zion Williamson. Nichols was the only voter that had Williamson on their Most Improved ballot.

https://imgur.com/zrrbJqZ

I’ve done this analysis for the past three seasons and one of the reoccurring trends has been that female media members tend to score lower on the contrarianism scale than male voters. I think part of that has to do with the fact that female media members are more likely to be the subject of ad hominem attacks and unfair criticism from fans for casting an unconventional ballot. So perhaps out of self-preservation, female voters tend to make fewer controversial choices than male voters do. Of the 13 female media members that voted on this year’s awards, only two (The Ringer’s Seerat Sohi and ESPN’s Ramona Shelburne) ranked in the top 50 in terms of contrarianism.

Again, contrarianism isn’t a bad thing. The whole point of having a voting body is so that a wide variety of opinions are represented. If everyone’s opinions were the same there’d be no need to take a vote in the first place. If anything, contrarianism shows that the system is working like it should.

However, I’m not certain the NBA league office feels the same way. When I conducted this exercise [last season](https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/ix06rb/oc_ranking_all_100_media_members_who_vote_on_the/), Greg Logan of Newsday and Joe Cowley of the Chicago Sun-Times ranked as the two most contrarian voters. Neither Logan or Cowley was given a vote this year and I have to wonder if that isn't a coincidence. If my suspicions are correct, I’d be surprised to see Max Haupt’s name on an awards ballots next season.

Also, try as they might, I think the NBA will forever have a difficult time soliciting votes from unbiased voters. Over the years, they’ve made attempts to minimize bias by taking away votes from each team’s home broadcasters. But local reporters often end up falling prey to the same bias by voting for the players and coaches they cover the most. For example, Keith Pompey of the Philadelphia Inquirer was one of only two voters to give Doc Rivers, the coach of the Philadelphia 76ers, a first-place vote for Coach of the Year. Does Pompey still make that vote if Doc Rivers is coaching a different team? (**Shakes Magic 8 Ball**: My sources say no.)

This year, there were voters from 21 local markets and 19 of them voted for at least one player or coach in their home market for at least one award. The only two that didn’t were Scott Kushner of the New Orleans Times Picayune and Roy Parry of the Orlando Sentinel. And even then, Parry still voted for former Magic player Nikola Vucevic for Third Team All-NBA.

But given the financial ramifications that are at stake for players that win or lose an award, I think the least a voter can do is write a column or appear on a show or a podcast to discuss (not defend!) their choices. I think if fans got to read or hear a voter’s thought-process for why they voted the way they did there’d be far less vitriol directed at them for going against the grain.

"nbadiscussion","houstontrashbros","Realistic Ben Simmons trade possibilities","2021-21-06 11:01:07 AM","I've seen a lot of talk about trading Simmons, for obvious reasons, but most of it is just memes or dreams, so I wanted to actually take a look around and see if there are any real possibilities out there.

The first and most obvious that people are talking about is Ben for CJ McCollum.  While on it's face this looks like a win win for both teams, I doubt that Morey will see that as equal value.  I don't believe CJ is good enough to be the perimeter creator that they need to put them over the top, and I can see Portland being hesitant to send more assets back, when Simmons' value, despite being an all-star and all-defense player, is at an all time low.  Many people have also been speculating about a Lillard trade, but despite his recent tweets, nothing he has done has indicated that he wants to leave Portland, and the only way they trade him is if he pulls a Harden, which I don't think is in his character.

The next most obvious trade partner would probably be OKC, who's recent MO has been to take on these types of projects.  If I'm Morey, I'm seeing if I can get a deal done for SGA.  This would mean attaching picks to Simmons, but to me I see much more potential for SGA to be a top level perimeter creator than CJ.  From the OKC side, I can't see SGA as being untouchable when they have no clear picture of what their roster is going to look like even next year, and Simmons is only two years older.  The money isn't even close, but if I'm not mistaken the Thunder have 60m+ in space so they should just be able to absorb him into space.  Morey and Presti also have a very good working relationship, which certainly doesn't hurt.

Another obvious target would be Beal, for whom you'd have to send a king's ransom ala the packages for Harden, AD etc.  This, to me, is the highest guaranteed return though of the three trades, so I believe you have to pursue it.  One might say that the Wizards would never agree to pair up Russ and Simmons, but if they are trading Beal they are committing to a full rebuild until Russ's contract is up regardless, so being bad in the meantime would be beneficial.  If they can talk themselves into Ben developing more of an offensive game once he gets out of Philly, I could see them willing to do the deal for the right price.  I think the fit of Beal and Embiid would be basically perfect, game and personality wise, so I'd definitely be willing to go all in on it.  Are three or four firsts plus Simmons enough to get it done?  I'd throw in Maxey as well if I was Morey.

Finally, I would look at Zach Lavine.  Although he's basically a poor man's Beal, he is, again, at least a tier above CJ in my opinion and has shown continued improvement.  Chicago is reeling after going all in at the trade deadline and failing to make the playoffs, so they might be willing to entertain the possibility of a Simmons Lavine swap, especially if it recoups some of their draft stock.  On paper Simmons would mesh well with Vucevic, who is more of a stretch big than Embiid, would obviously do a lot for them on defense, and with Koby White on the roster would not have to shoulder all of the perimeter creation duties.  Again, you would have to attach picks, and this might be a sticking point if Chicago expect a Beal-esque package, but if they can convince themselves that they can rehabilitate Simmons, there might be a deal to be done.

After the comments from Embiid and Rivers, I think it's a foregone conclusion that Simmons is not on the Sixers roster at the start of next season, and it's going to be very interesting to see how it all plays out.","t3_o519sv","https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/o519sv/realistic_ben_simmons_trade_possibilities/",2,34,"t1_h2kj58u","2021-21-06 12:21:57 PM","Why would anyone trade for Ben simmons when you give up: SGA / Lavine / CJ You'd have to give a lot to get either of those guys.

I think I would predict Bucks in 7 right now, but I wouldn't be shocked by hawks in 6 or bucks in 5.  Trae was phenomenal against brook in drop coverage and Bud is definitely going to go back to Brook. Trae isn't going to shoot that well again - but his teammates can combine for better than 4-19 from deep too.  Middleton was awful but Jrue was on fire and Giannis was very efficient at the rim. I *think* the Bucks have more adjustments to make and that when both teams are playing at their best they will beat ATL handily. But the Bucks often play below their talent level, and Bud allowed Jeff Teague to check Trae WHILE JRUE WAS IN THE GAME.  So hennything is possible.

Man has been great on offense, as usual, but his defense has been surprisingly solid.  That said, I would not be surprised if this is the last game the Hawks win. I don't have too much faith in Bud, but there were a few glaring mistakes that can easily be fixed for G2, and I fully expect Milwaukee to bounce back strong. I'm struggling to think of a time when Middleton was 0-9 from 3PT, and Lopez was uncharacteristically terrible.  Bottom line, without a healthy Bogy and without Hunter, I don't know if Atlanta has the firepower to knock off Milwaukee. They play so freely and with absolutely no hesitation, its fun as hell to watch, but the Bucks are a disciplined team and barring a complete breakdown on Bud's part, I see them going to the Finals.

I also have the Raptors, who dropped from a second seed to twelfth after a Covid-rampant season in Tampa. I think adding the fourth pick + back to Toronto/no Covid has them getting back to a mid-playoff seed (12 -> 4/5). The Warriors get Klay back as well, and bearing a relatively-full recovery and win-now trades to utilize Steph’s window,  I can see them jumping into the middle of the standings as well (9 -> 4/5).

Pelicans are simple. I think the coaching move alone (whatever it may be) will result in some wins. Add to that some players who might be better fits with zion through free agency or trades and the team could be scary. Only thing that would make this tough is that the west is a bloodbath. They might be 5-10 wins better and go from an 11 seed to a 9 seed.  Bulls is contingent on them getting a real pg. I like what Coby White can be but right now hes a bench spark plug to me not a starting caliber pg at this point, especially for a team who wants the ball in Lavines hands a lot. If they can get someone like Lonzo or even Dinwiddie I can see this team making a huge leap.  OKC is just purely off how low they finished + how good they were with Shai + internal development + teams not taking them seriously. I think they could possibly shock some teams and finish in the playin just because I think Shai is that good and if he takes another mini leap we could be talking about him as a top 20/25 player.

With this signing they wanted to clear cap space given how cheap owner Robert Sarver was, shown through his willingness to trade the 7th overall pick in 2004 (Luol Deng) for $3 million on draft night.  Veteran Kurt Thomas and his near $8 million salary was then packaged with first round picks in 2008 and 2010 for a 2009 second round pick (which was later traded for cash) and a trade exception.  The first round picks then became Serge Ibaka and Quincy Pondexter.  Essentially the Suns traded away Ibaka for what became cash, meaning that in a span of 3 years the Suns traded away the draft picks that became Luol Deng, Rajon Rondo, and Serge Ibaka all in exchange for cash when following the trade trees to their conclusions.  There is no doubt in my mind that the Suns win the 2010 Finals if they keep these three players on the roster given that they lost to the champion Lakers in 6 games in the WCF, including a 2 point loss in a critical game 5 that saw them go down 3-2","t3_ob1564","https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/ob1564/the_serge_ibaka_trade_is_an_underrated_horrible/",208,36,"t1_h3nrv2m","2021-01-07 1:02:53 AM","they trade the 7th pick (Deng) for the 31st pick and a future 1st, still a bad deal but thats should absolutely be mentioned cause they didnt trade that for cash considerations straight up",1,0.065,0.867,0.068,0.0258,2.18

Because of this, instead of the CP3-Ayton connection that we all tuned in to watch, we got CP3-Frank the Tank. It’s the finals, and we are not seeing the best basketball possible because of a seemingly arbitrary foul limit. 


I don’t think it’s good for the game to have the best players sitting on the bench for large stretches of the game in what is essentially a “time out” for bad behavior. Imagine if Chris Godwin had to sit out of the 3rd quarter of the Super Bowl because he had been called for holding too much in the first half. 

Also, so many calls in the NBA are judgement calls and if a few iffy whistles come your way, it could change your entire game plan by removing one of your best players. It becomes a huge issue in OT and 2OT games when the game is literally longer than normal but the foul limit stays at 6. Every time I see a 2OT game it seems like people are fouling out left and right. 

What is the point of the foul limit? If the goal is to discourage “dirty” play, is the limit too low?

I think at the very least, the limit should be raised to 8. Deandre Ayton was not playing dirty last night. He wasn’t being a menace, and he didn’t deserve to be removed from the game for such a long stretch. And if we are going to eject players for committing common fouls, I think they should have to foul A LOT before actually being ejected.

That way a guy may have to sit some for a half but it doesn't totally screw the game.  I realize fouls are sometimes bad plays and sometimes part of a strategy.    I also don't really mind the 3 shots to make 2 free throws (or 4 shots to make 3) when fouled by someone who has a lot of fouls.  Maybe that would be something to consider - give a set foul limit per half ( such as 3 or 4) and have those reset at the half to zero. So you get a fresh slate the second half.  But mix in that once a player gets 6 fouls total (first and second half total) the player fouled gets an extra shot at his free throw attempts.  Then once the limit of fouls per half are reached the player fouls out.  If the game goes to OT the player gets a clean slate again but the extra free throw attempt remains.",1,0.026,0.833,0.141,0.9655,2.91

But why is nobody talking about it on this sub?

First, let me say really quick that this would be a terrible trade for the Pacers. For their sake, I’m glad the Sixers declined. Simmons would be a terrible fit alongside either or both of Sabonis and Turner and would set a franchise that already struggles to get big name free agents multiple years back with his massive overpay of a contract.

But anyways, let’s talk about the Sixers side of things. 

Why the hell would they decline this trade? Brogdon is a WAY better three point shooter, WAY better free throw shooter, is on a much more reasonable and affordable contract (they would actually save about 11 million dollars making this trade), and is good enough at perimeter defense to where you could make this move and not have to make other moves to bolster your perimeter defense. They would also be eliminating competition, by giving the Pacers, a team in their own conference, someone who does not fit on their team. I hope that the Sixers don’t think they will get someone better than Brogdon for Simmons, because unless they use draft picks, they will not get an offer better than this Pacers deal. Gone are the days of Simmons being the centerpiece in a potential James Harden deal. This actually brings me to my next point.

The Sixers only have four tradeable first round picks. They have their 2021 first round pick, their 2023 first round pick, their 2022 first round pick (which would have to be a pick swap because of the Stepien rule), and their 2028 first round pick (which we don’t know how valuable that pick will be because it’s so damn far in the future). Considering Ben Simmons current trade value and how hard it is to build around him, the most that could get them is maybe a C.J. McCollum if he becomes available. On top of that, Milton, Maxey, and Thybulle are their only real young assets, and they aren’t enough to significantly alter what the Sixers would get for Ben Simmons. They would be much better off trading for the younger Malcolm Brogdon, keeping their draft picks, acquiring an additional draft pick, and saving their young assets for another trade.","t3_od637z","https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/od637z/why_on_gods_green_earth_did_the_sixers_decline/",0,44,"t1_h3za9g5","2021-03-07 6:41:22 PM","It was likely a fake trade leaked by the sixers FO to establish a market floor for a Ben Simmons deal.

This then starts setting the floor for what they’re willing to accept. Also PHI can and should have no interest in trading Simmons at the floor of his value league-wide like right now. They should wait to let him recoup some value. Brogdon is also injury-prone (hasn’t played close to a full season since his rookie year), only about league-average efficiency (56% TS and eFG%), and doesn’t draw a ton of fouls (averages about 3 FTA/game, low for a lead ball-handler). Also Myles Turner is *exactly* the type of C Simmons should play next to - a good rim protector who is also a stretch-5 (average shot distance 14ft who takes 47% of his shots from 3) which keeps the lane unclogged for Simmons to drive-and-kick or at worst sit in the dunkers spot. Sabonis I agree would not be a good fit for Simmons. IND struggling to sign free agents is also *why* they make this type of trade - because a player of Simmons’ caliber or higher is not coming in free agency. It’s how IND gets their best players - through trades (Brogdon was a S&T RFA, Sabonis was a trade, LeVert was a trade, when he was there and good Oladipo was a trade) or the draft (Turner). Also PHI is not worried about eliminating the 9th seed who couldn’t win the play-in against WAS. Finally yes PHI currently only has three tradeable picks and one swap because of the pick they’re out to OKC - they call up Presti, unprotect the pick for ‘25 and send OKC a 2nd for the trouble (the going rate for unprotecting a pick) They then have ‘21, ‘23, ‘27 and swap rights in ‘22, ‘24, ‘26 and ‘28. It’s not that dire a pick situation. They might not want to do that but that’s the price of business if a star player comes available.",11,0.046,0.856,0.098,0.9188,3.48

Crowder looked like he was being left on an island last game. On the other hand the Suns have probably defended the rest of the Bucks a little better. So Giannis goes for 40 but if the rest of the team struggles it’s not enough.

This is a strategy I like against a team like Dwight Magic who was surrounded by lights out guys but I’m not sure the Bucks are the best to use it against. Their personnel isn’t totally lights out in terms of shooting and one of the issues is they play at such a high defense and rebounding intensity that they are gassed on offense hence why a player like Holiday has been hot/cold on offense since he is everywhere on defense. I would take my chances with bigs like Tucker, Lopez and Portis open from 3 in the long run if it means defending Giannis better, they may hit some but I don’t know if they can win the series that way.

Maybe, crazier things have happened but t think it’s safe to say he won’t.   With that being said, I think his full potential has yet to be unlocked, but could be given the right circumstances. 

The Embiid and Simmons pairing isn’t working in the postseason because the two aren’t a great fit.  Embiid needs a guard that can spread the floor and give him the room to work s in down low, not one that has to sit in the dunkers spot for possessions at a time because he can’t shoot. And I personally believe that Simmons needs a rim roller type big to really thrive.  Simmons is one of the best passers and drivers in the game which both bode well for the P&R, look at what Harden and Trae young have been able to do with Capela, as well as what CP3 was able to do with guys like Deandre Jordan and Blake Griffin.  Now I know Harden Young and CP3 all poses the ability to shoot the ball coming off the screen and make floaters in the lane before getting to the rim, making their P&Rs less predictable but none of them are 6’10 and and are as intimidating as a full head of steam Simmons coming at the rim. 

Too dive deeper into screens, I think Simmons is one of if not the most interesting P&R men in the league.  He has the IQ, passing ability, and handle to be an excellent ball handler, but he also has the size, speed, and finishing ability to be just as good a roller.  Simmons has never played with another high level perimeter creator that can put him in the correct positions that beat suit his skill set. Look at lamelo and Miles Bridges, bridges efficiency has sky rocketed since Melo joined, and I believe that Simmons’ athleticism is comparable to that of bridges, so if you put another quality playmaker around him I think it would unlock a Simmons we have yet to see. 

My final point is that he is not a damn point guard!!!! I don’t care what anyone says he’s not a guard, he’s a big that can handle and pass the ball and that’s how he should play. If you play Simmons more at the Center position, it creates such a mismatch for the other teams , you either force the other team to go smaller to keep up with Ben and then you use his size as an advantage, and if they keep traditional centers on him he can take them off the dribble with ease.

Maybe, crazier things have happened but t think it’s safe to say he won’t.   With that being said, I think his full potential has yet to be unlocked, but could be given the right circumstances. 

The Embiid and Simmons pairing isn’t working in the postseason because the two aren’t a great fit.  Embiid needs a guard that can spread the floor and give him the room to work s in down low, not one that has to sit in the dunkers spot for possessions at a time because he can’t shoot. And I personally believe that Simmons needs a rim roller type big to really thrive.  Simmons is one of the best passers and drivers in the game which both bode well for the P&R, look at what Harden and Trae young have been able to do with Capela, as well as what CP3 was able to do with guys like Deandre Jordan and Blake Griffin.  Now I know Harden Young and CP3 all poses the ability to shoot the ball coming off the screen and make floaters in the lane before getting to the rim, making their P&Rs less predictable but none of them are 6’10 and and are as intimidating as a full head of steam Simmons coming at the rim. 

Too dive deeper into screens, I think Simmons is one of if not the most interesting P&R men in the league.  He has the IQ, passing ability, and handle to be an excellent ball handler, but he also has the size, speed, and finishing ability to be just as good a roller.  Simmons has never played with another high level perimeter creator that can put him in the correct positions that beat suit his skill set. Look at lamelo and Miles Bridges, bridges efficiency has sky rocketed since Melo joined, and I believe that Simmons’ athleticism is comparable to that of bridges, so if you put another quality playmaker around him I think it would unlock a Simmons we have yet to see. 

My final point is that he is not a damn point guard!!!! I don’t care what anyone says he’s not a guard, he’s a big that can handle and pass the ball and that’s how he should play. If you play Simmons more at the Center position, it creates such a mismatch for the other teams , you either force the other team to go smaller to keep up with Ben and then you use his size as an advantage, and if they keep traditional centers on him he can take them off the dribble with ease.

Back in the days Team USA was not only the most talented by far, but the most physical as well. However now with 3 pt shooting being a larger focal point of the offense, it has kind of evened out the playing field a bit more. Reason behind this is that anyone can now get hot individually or as  team together and simply outscore an opponent with no response.

I understand that this is just a 1 game sample size and I have no doubt that Team USA will bounce back strong and have an amazing tournament, but this just got me thinking.","t3_oi2nwt","https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/oi2nwt/has_the_rise_of_the_3_point_shot_evened_out_the/",655,80,"t1_h4stir1","2021-11-07 4:56:01 AM","Not really, what the 3 point shot does is increase the variance of extremes.

For example a team that shoots 50% from 2P and 37% from 3P will see an 11% increase in expected points per possession by taking a three.  Since both sides have all the freedom to bomb from three it doesn't make anything any more level or lopsided.

For instance, there is a huge group of people that defend players like Westbrook, Giannis and Gobert despite the fact that they have come up short of expectations in the playoffs.

Just to be clear, I put A LOT of value in the playoffs. I love play off basketball, and the teams I route for I don't want to just have a great regular season followed by a 1st round exit.

I think it also boils down to the fact that a coach's playoff adjustments' success seems pretty binary to the average fan -- it either works or doesn't. Taking the players you mentioned into account, all three of those guys have had perimeter-centric All-Stars who can create this ""gray area."" If someone else plays well (and even if the team loses), they just won't receive as much flak because it wasn't totally explicit and got overshadowed. For Gobert, I think Game 1 of the West semis was a great example of this. He struggled on offense and mostly had a limited defensive impact unlike his dominance in the regular season. But he got the game-winning block and Mitchell dropped 45, so his struggles just weren't as apparent. Then look at Bud, who got a ton of criticism even after beating the Nets in Game 7. The play he drew up at the end of regulation which ended in that horrible fadeaway baseline shot was entirely on him. Why? Because in a fan's eyes he's the singular guy in charge. Without anyone else visibly at his position (a star has teammates, a coach doesn't have a co-head coach), there's no other place to distribute blame that stems from a sideline mistake. A player on the other hand, isn't supposed to be ""the guy in charge."" If that were truly the case, they would probably (and rightfully) get the benefit of the doubt from not having any help.

If you get off to a horrific start, that’s enough to make a player or coach change. But if you roll along fine, have to deal with injuries, or stay at least competitive, it’s harder to judge off regular season.  Playoffs are a much more accurate gauge. That’s the moment you get to see coaches under pressure. How do they make adjustments? How do they handle adversity? Can they get the most out of their best players in the big moments when it matters?  Playoff results are much more telling for what a coach actually is. For example, guys like Mike Budenholzer and Doc Rivers have strange rotations that usually get picked apart. Coaches like Ty Lue are shown to be full of adjustments and making minutes count. Coaches like Spo and Pop find a way to get the most out of their players and run good systems when it matters.

Who is willing to trade for a smaller guard who’s currently a defensive liability? Which team is Sexton an upgrade on their guard situation worth giving up assets for? Who’s willing to give up assets for a pending RFA that CLE seems to not want to pay AND give him the money he’ll seek in an extension or in RFA? It’s just a lot of questions that makes it a stickier situation to get a clear answer on. I’ll also add from an OKC perspective the questions I have as well: Is he a big enough upgrade offensively over Dort to make the sacrifice on the defensive downgrade? Can SGA or Dort hold up defensively at the 3? Do you even want SGA exerting that much energy on that end given how efficient he is offensively? And can Sexton play well enough defensively to let those lineups play? Why is CLE shopping him after 3 years instead of paying him? If the answer is “he’s not good enough to be a starter on a playoff team” then do you believe them or think they’re vastly underrating their own player? What is CLE asking for him? And are you comfortable paying him on an extension or in RFA (reminder about the Kanter RFA contract) knowing that you’re probably going to match since you gave up assets for him?

Early to mid 2000s football (soccer) was characterised by tactful defence, which I think made the star players appear better than they perhaps were relative to this era, followed by an offensive explosion such as Pep Guardiola’s Barcelona. Tennis saw this as well with Federer’s proactive serve and volley style, in combination with an elite all around game, preceded by Novak Djokovic’s more reactive you’re gonna have to try your absolute hardest on every point to beat me given I can return everything. 

How do you see the defensive response to the space and pace era of basketball evolving over the next few years? I think it is not in doubt that in this current era of basketball, the elite offensives of teams far surpasses the defence. Will this come in the form of perhaps a change to spacing through rule changes e.g. changing the 3 point line to eliminate corners 3s. Or perhaps this is not a large concern given the variability seen in 3 point shooting, particularly in the playoffs.

They’re dying to see what other people think in the poll and why they think so in the comments.  

This all started with Caleb (a Hawks fan) saying “What are the Hawks doing with Kyrie?”  Ben (a Hornets fan) had his jimmies rustled after reading this.  They argued and Ben has very graciously summed up his argument for us.  His argument is below.  

“Kyrie Irving is a better player than Trae Young mainly due having significantly fewer exposable weaknesses than Young. We all know that Trae can take over a game and may very well be the best passer in the league, but Kyrie is superior in all other facets. Trae Young, while a microwave, is not efficient. He shot only 42% from the field and 31% from 3 in the playoffs. Irving, on the other hand, just finished a season averaging 27 PPG on 50/40/90. He is not the playmaker that Trae is, but he has shown the ability to average 7 assists per game over a season. Last but not least, Trae Young may be the worst defender in recent NBA memory. While Kyrie is certainly no elite defender, he competes far better than Trae. Couple that with Kyrie being one of the most clutch players on the planet, and the decision is simple.”  

Caleb has decided to not sum up his opinion so I’ll do it for him the best I can.  

He feels as is kyrie’s advantages aren’t that great.  He thinks Kyrie is only slightly better in scoring and defending.  When it comes to passing he believes Trae is lightyears better.  He also believes Trae can lead a team and an offense better.  He cites Kyrie’s time in Boston as proof Kyrie can’t lead a team.  He thinks Kyrie had a more talented team and yet accomplished less than what Trae had with a less talented team.  Caleb doesn’t think it is fair that Kyrie can get a pass with the Celtics, but Trae was criticized last year for being the 14th seed.  He believes that this is the ultimate proof that Trae is better.  He doesn’t think Kyrie can lead a team like Trae. Caleb says this year Trae led his team deeper in the playoffs with less help than Kyrie on the Celtics.  He also thinks injuries play a part in this, but Ben and Caleb compromised to exclude injuries for Reddit.  

So which player is better when healthy?  Please read everything they had to say and explain your reasoning in the comments.  This argument needs to be settled in my group chat so y’all can settle it for them.  For Caleb’s sake please ponder what the Hawks are doing with Kyrie instead of Trae this year.","t3_of0giq","https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/of0giq/who_is_a_better_player_when_healthy_kyrie_irving/",0,22,"t1_h49yjzu","2021-06-07 1:17:58 PM","Kyrie. People put way too much value on small sample sizes. Trae did somewhat better and had his team do better in his one playoff run as a #1 option than Kyrie did in his one playoff run as a #1 option so people think Trae is the better player when healthy. That's a terrible metric though. If we went by a few games at 27 years old, we would say Lebron is a terrible player once you get to the Finals and his inability to take charge and perform on that stage will inevitably make his legacy in terms of championships be disappointing and maybe even that Dirk is a better Finals performer and thus more valuable. A decade and four chips and FMVPs later later and that is very much not the narrative. All the evidence says that right now Kyrie is the better player to have. Trae may eventually develop enough to surpass him but that isn't the case yet.",5,0.048,0.849,0.104,0.7506,3.04

They are in a good position to have an infusion of young, but raw talent. This raw, young talent has to be balanced with their veteran but aging and somewhat banged up core of Steph Curry, Klay Thompson and Draymond Green. I believe this trio still has a contendership window, but it's closer to a 1-2 year window than a 3-4 year window. 

Their most recent coaching hires are Kenny Atkinson and Toronto Raptors assistant Jama Mahlalela. I don't know too much about Jama, but it seems like they are credited for being a good player development coach. 

For the next 3 years, I think the Warriors are going to be the most fascinating team to watch from an organizational perspective. What route are they going to take to maximize the tail-end of Steph Curry's prime? Steph is 33 and we see CP3 still ripping it up in the Finals on a young talent stacked team. The Phoenix Suns provide some interesting elements for the GSW blueprint. So I would hesitate to close the window on Steph when he is 37, but that's a stupid thing to design your plan around. Maximizing Steph's age 34, 35, 36 seasons must be the priority.

These two coaching hires seem good in a vacuum, absent the GSW draft capital. But given the context, it seems to me that GSW is going to try to balance contending right now while investing in their future (beyond a 1-2 year contendership window). 

From a financial point of view, I think GSW cannot realistically foot the massive luxury tax bill. They need to look to in-house player development in order to get their roster over the hump. Their new stadium was supposed to be a cash-printing machine, but the pandemic in all likelihood ruined their financial projections. 

One last factor for me is what happens if Klay or Dray show some noticable declines in play (I feel confident Steph has some top-5 MVP seasons left). Not necessarily next year, but in 2 years let's say. Do they blow up the core? Navigating the tail-end of an aging dynasty is difficult.

Curry sparking a team with unrivaled depth down to the bench, and a playstyle predicated on that roster construction, was pretty magical. Hard to just accept that it can't be incrementally reclaimed with too many parts of the equation changed (although the front office group has shown themselves to be pretty savvy). Their current obligations feel like their only team build option is the LeBron model where they overpay average vets and end up with 2-ish bench-caliber players in their starting lineup, and a bench full of guys who are marginal league members.

Not future picks but 7, 14 and Wiseman. I am a Warriors fan. I think Wiseman has plenty of potential, he may be a great player in the future, it just isn't realistic to get him the reps he needs and contend. The Warriors either play him low minutes which is bad for development or they bench him at crucial times, bad for confidence. Wiseman needs more breathing room. Wiseman was basically a HS player being thrown into the NBA last year, he showed flashed or really good talent but defensively and as far as knowing schemes and BBIQ there is a lot of room for improvement. It's going to take two or three years. The Warriors don't have that time. Curry is in the tail end of his prime.  Furthermore Klay is coming off a two year absence and might not be the same. Draymond is still effective but not in his prime anymore. I would say in the best case scenario Draymond, Klay and Curry have two years of everything goes right. They need players in the same points in their career. Players that can play in the Warriors system.  Here is the thing. Kerr might be able to just ride Curry to the playoffs even with young inexperienced players if he changed his system to a pick and roll based system like D'Antoni. The issue seems to he Curry just absolutely not wanting to play this way. Curry likes running around off-ball he likes the motion offense. The thing is as far as last year Wiseman, Oubre and a few others were not good in that scheme, it requires that read and react skillset with quick passes, not every player can do that. My feeling is that the Warriors should regroup and reassess their talent and build a team to win this way and try and make one or two more runs before they start building for the future while trying to win now. If Curry reaches the end of his prime and he wants to end his career with the Warriors in the way Dirk did with Dallas or Duncan did with SA that seems like a good scenario to have Curry kind of lay the framework for an organizational culture moving forward.

In today's superteam oriented NBA, he'd be absurdly valuable because you can pug-in and play him with any super star and he'd be a force multiplier.  Defensively, he had god-tier basketball IQ and was one of the best help defenders in the league, though his lack of athleticism limited his ability as a one-on-one defender since more athletic guys can blow by him.  His length and instincts mitigated this though and he was an important part of some great defenses in his prime.  If there was one area in the game that he'd probably be hurt the most it would be his defense, since the lack of athleticism is more exploitable but I don't think he'd be a liability.  Just maybe not as good as Durant was defensively at his apex.   Also, remember that Larry Bird was essentially a power forward who played small forward because he was good enough to play there to make room for other Kevin McHale.

My understanding of Bird would be similar to how guys who started watching ball in the 2010's understand Kobe so I'm certainly not the authority here but with that being said I would probably take Bird over Durant (whose career i've definitely been around for since the beginning).  Bird I think would have functioned similar to a more athletic and smaller Jokic with an even higher BBIQ or a less athletic but more crafty and overall better Luca. Now I personally don't believe Bird would have been as good today relative to the rest of the league as he was back in the 80's, can't see him winning 3 straight MVP's for example, but a slightly less good Bird is still better than peak Durant. Bird literally did everything significantly better than KD except for scoring and even in that department it was close. KD is maybe a tier or a half tier above Bird as a scorer and IMO KD is a top 3ish scorer of all time but Bird was a generationally gifted scorer, a generationally gifted playmaker, an excellent rebounder for his position and a better defender than KD. Less importantly but it's still a facotr, in terms of intangibles as well Bird's killer instinct is on that MJ/Kobe level while KD is just doesn't seem to have that compared to those guys at least.  Now with all that being said, I do think Birds relative lack of athleticism does hurt him a bit in todays game. Bird wasn't a bad athlete but he was pretty average for an NBA athlete in the 80's and while the best players from the 80's are right on par with todays best players athletically, the overall athleticism of the league has certainly made leaps and bounds today compared to then. Given that, I do think the overall openness and spacing of todays game does make up for a wide majority of that drop in athleticism relative to his peers.",1,0.049,0.776,0.175,0.9946,3.25
"nbadiscussion","Asheskell","Kristaps Porzingis for Ben Simmons","2021-28-06 1:17:43 AM","Following underwhelming playoff performances the knee-jerk reactions of both Mavericks and Sixers fans have been fairly predictable. Both fanbases see a clear #1 option on their team who needs more help from a suitable supporting cast. 

For the Sixers; Embiid is 27 with two more years left on his contract (https://www.spotrac.com/nba/philadelphia-76ers/joel-embiid-15355/). After a near-MVP season that really signalled the Big Man having hit his prime there is probably more urgency to Philly's need for all hands on deck in the quest for the chip. Embiid has battled with injuries for much of his career, but his high value on both ends of the floor is by now tried and true.

For the Mavericks; two losses to the Clippers in a row is... what it is? There is a narrative that both losses were 'hard-fought' and generally a credit to the Mavs squad, but in the end a loss is a loss. I have my doubts that Doncic, a well-documented competitor, is going to be satisfied with first-round exits for long. Being 22 and on a team built around him from the ground up, however, probably affords the Mavericks ownership and front office some breathing room in comparison to the Sixers.

Both the Sixers' and the Mavs' 2nd options have, as mentioned, had disappointing post-season performances. Simmons' fit with Embiid has been discussed extensively for years, while Porzingis' sour relationship with Doncic and injury history has grated on the patience of many Mavs fans. 

Both teams could of course keep their assets; Simmons is an all-defense player with tremendous upside in transition, but his lack of a jump shot and, though a less concrete factor, lack of 'aggressiveness' and engagement detracts from his overall value. Embiid is a dominant force in the post; does Simmons' upsides make up for his lack of floor-spacing and, well, cluttering presence in the paint? For Porzingis, his value is the exact opposite; a 7'3 self-styled PF with an impressive jumper. Porzingis spaces the floor, but his defense - especially in the pick-and-roll - has been criticised. He also has a history of injuries that seem to have affected his athleticism, including shot-blocking and finishing ability.

The last year of Simmons' contract is 24-25, where he is owed 40 million plus change (https://www.spotrac.com/nba/philadelphia-76ers/ben-simmons-20206/). Porzingis' contract is slightly smaller and his last year is 23-24, where he is owed 36 million (https://www.spotrac.com/nba/dallas-mavericks/kristaps-porzingis-17832/).

Now, I wouldn't want to speculate about an exact trade package, but the idea of Simmons for Porzingis has intrigued me. In being traded both players escape less than desirable situations. Embiid's comment on the Sixers' game 7 are telling to me, and as mentioned before Porzingis' relationship with Doncic seems strained at best. They are both relatively young star players; 24 for Simmons and 25 for Porzingis, with known upsides and the potential for growth, or perhaps more accurately recovery in Porzingis' case.

For the Sixers, Porzingis would instantly open up the floor for Embiid. Despite a narrative of inefficiency the Latvian put up 20/9 on 47 FG%, shooting 37.6% from downtown this season. He can play the 4 and 5 interchangeably and can be counted on for isolation buckets when pressed. I believe a health...-ier Porzingis after a full off-season can offer dynamic range to a Sixers squad that could use it. Their starting 5 would look something like:

a) Curry/Milton, Green, Harris, Porzingis, Embiid.

Porzingis would also fit better next to often traditional backup big men like Howard, who will likely see more playing time when Embiid is out with injuries. And when Porzingis himself is out his absence just sees the Sixers go back to the kind of basketball they have been playing for 2-3 seasons now.
The trade costs the Sixers defensively, but even if Porzingis stands as still as a traffic cone his presence alone enables Embiid to operate more freely, perhaps in the process sparing him from getting so banged up by the constant double-teams Simmons invites when on the floor with Embiid.

For the Mavs, Simmons would be a devastating defensive presence for a team that has been sorely missing it. Simmons is one of the few legitimate 1-5 defenders in the league. On offense Simmons' athleticism and playmaking ability would make him a very hand-in-glove fit next to Doncic, who seems more comfortable with traditional rollers. At 6'10 Simmons can run, dunk, catch lobs and pass out of the post. I could also see him feasting on mismatches when fed down low. Doncic loves the deep post feeds against mismatches, as evidenced every single time Marjanovic touches the hardwood. For the Mavs, their starting 5 with Simmons would look something like:

b) Doncic, Hardaway Jr., Finney-Smith/Richardson, Powell/Kleber, Simmons

You could play Simmons at whatever position, so long as his role was clearly defined. The trade costs the Mavs in spacing, but not by much. The team's backup bigs are solid shooters and Powell especially can make a living above the rim catching lobs.

For both players there are questions about gumption. Both could retreat further into themselves and their bad habits: Porzingis taking post touches from Embiid or chucking above-the-break 3s on every catch is less than ideal. The same can be said for a version of Simmons that does not rebound, go hard in the paint, or run and roll with urgency. For Simmons especially, in my opinion, effort can be a big difference-maker. I do believe, however, that taking Embiid out of the equation opens up more of an opportunity for Simmons to see the paint as 'his territory'; a place where he can dominate without worrying about taking touches from Embiid.

>This is probably where the league's headed, less of the same dudes and more of a focus on former players that can relate more to the current players

Furthermore, user urfaselol made an observation that 3 of the 4 head coaches in the Conference Finals were former players, with Mike Budenholzer being the lone holdout.

This was intriguing to me, and I wanted to see whether this was actually a trend. (User migibb, in the same comment chain gave a [breakdown of the 2011 coaches](https://np.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/ogh3sm/highkin_damian_lillard_on_chauncey_billups/h4iyh7i/))

First, I gathered all the coaches from Basketball-Reference's Coach Register, as well as each season's coaches. Next I loaded in a dataset I'd already gathered of player totals, only taking player identifying information. I joined the three of them together on name as well as birth year (the latter to separate fathers & sons).

With the data now finalized, it's time to plot some graphs!

Here's a plot of the [**number of players-turned-coaches by year**](https://i.imgur.com/9VxKuhk.png). To the contrary, we're actually on a downward swing. The all-time high occurred in 2009, where 30 of 39 head coaches had experience in the NBA, ranging from Hall of Famers Maurice Cheeks in Philadelphia and Kevin McHale in Minnesota to Sacramento's Kenny Natt, who played 49 games across three seasons.

Instead of the total number, let's take a look at the [**percent of players-turned-coaches by year**](https://i.imgur.com/6i7BQdK.png). All 13 coaches in 1967 had playing experience, the most famous being Bill Russell as player-coach for the Boston Celtics at that point.

What about the [**number of players-turned-coaches by team**](https://i.imgur.com/b0t2iU3.png)? The Knicks lead the pack with 20, while the current iteration of the Hornets (CHO abbreviation) have not yet hired a former player. (As a caveat, I haven't been able to group abbreviations under the same franchise.)

Lastly, the [**percent of players-turned-coaches by team**](https://i.imgur.com/xeWhKup.png). A bunch of defunct teams evidently only hired former players, with the St. Louis Hawks (an earlier iteration of the current Atlanta Hawks) leading the pack with 10/10. Here's a [**version of just current franchises**](https://i.imgur.com/jMPCm9R.png). The current Hornets have only hired 2 coaches, neither of which played in the NBA.

They have an aging and injury prone Kawhi Leonard who has mysterious handlings of his injuries and doesn’t seem like much of a team leader. They have Paul George who has been better at times this postseason, but has also still come up short at times where the moment needs him to come through. It seems like another wasted year in the Paul George-Kawhi Leonard era. 

A few things going for them: Terance Mann is developing into a fine-caliber role player. Reggie Jackson is playing some of his best basketball ever. Tyronn Lue is proving to be an upgrade at head coach over Doc Rivers. They seem to be a more resilient team than we’re used to. 

But they’re a team capped out and low on realistic flexibility going forward. Kawhi and Ibaka have POs. Jackson and Batum are UFAs this offseason. Most of their best draft capital was given to OKC in the PG trade. Teams such as the Lakers, Warriors, and Nuggets should be healthier in the West next season and will make the Clips path harder. 

I just don’t know what this team looks like in the future. They’re coming up short in their present iteration, and have aging superstars along with tough competition, but also have made some positive steps this season. What should they do going forward? How much longer do you keep the Kawhi-PG duo together?

They have two big stars who take up a lot of cap space, but that’s enough to make them legit contenders. Whether they can go all the way or not depends pretty much on whether their big two stay healthy and they can assemble a good supporting cast that performs well in the playoffs. The Lakers were able to do both last year, but neither this year. The Clippers didn’t do it last year and probably won’t this time either.  It’s worth remembering that winning the championship is really difficult. All but one team ends the season disappointed. And there’s some luck, bad matchups, hot/cold shooters, and other variables standing in your way. In the end it tends to be the team that stays healthier than the others and makes big plays, but there’s usually a lot of statistical noise that obscures that.",5,0.086,0.735,0.179,0.9457,3.29

If you look at the NFL, the majority of the networks and programs talk about the analysis of games. 

For example, how a defensive scheme won them certain possessions, what kind of route combinations the offensive coordinator drew up that week, how a QB managed to scramble and create a play on the fly.

I feel like I don't see any real basketball analysis on the popular networks and programs. I would love it if networks went into how the Suns' offense is being run through Chris Paul with Ayton and Booker, or how the Bucks should run their defense while Giannis is on the court.

I think teaching more basketball knowledge would cater to the existing fans more and provide insights to newer fans. I understand that the flashy plays and big names bring in the revenue, but this is an untapped market that I think will improve the health and interest of the game.

What do you guys think?","2021-12-07 5:55:54 PM","So last night Deandre Ayton spent a lot of time on the bench due to early foul trouble. He missed basically all of the 3rd quarter after picking up his fourth. 


Because of this, instead of the CP3-Ayton connection that we all tuned in to watch, we got CP3-Frank the Tank. It’s the finals, and we are not seeing the best basketball possible because of a seemingly arbitrary foul limit. 


I don’t think it’s good for the game to have the best players sitting on the bench for large stretches of the game in what is essentially a “time out” for bad behavior. Imagine if Chris Godwin had to sit out of the 3rd quarter of the Super Bowl because he had been called for holding too much in the first half. 

Also, so many calls in the NBA are judgement calls and if a few iffy whistles come your way, it could change your entire game plan by removing one of your best players. It becomes a huge issue in OT and 2OT games when the game is literally longer than normal but the foul limit stays at 6. Every time I see a 2OT game it seems like people are fouling out left and right.

I think at the very least, the limit should be raised to 8. Deandre Ayton was not playing dirty last night.

I also don't really mind the 3 shots to make 2 free throws (or 4 shots to make 3) when fouled by someone who has a lot of fouls.  Maybe that would be something to consider - give a set foul limit per half ( such as 3 or 4) and have those reset at the half to zero. So you get a fresh slate the second half.  But mix in that once a player gets 6 fouls total (first and second half total) the player fouled gets an extra shot at his free throw attempts.  Then once the limit of fouls per half are reached the player fouls out.

Trade #1 - Shake things up.  

Essentially an asset grab for PHI.  They get Wiggins, Okogie and two lottery picks this year.  They can use all of that for whatever they want to try and get for it, CJ, Siakam, whatever.  GSW adds a stud big man and can basically be the West Coast Nets.  Wolves get Simmons and Wiseman to pair with Edwards in a core that is more on the same time arc than Towns and Edwards.

Trade #2:  Oh Canada!  

This one looks a bit more Ujiri to me.  With Lowry likely out the door, Ujiri cashes in on Siakam and gets a haul in return.  Siakam-Curry-Thompson gives everyone in the West heartburn next year.  Meanwhile, the Raptors have 3 (!!) lottery picks this year, Wiggins goes back home and Wiseman comes along to help rebuild around the lottery haul.  FVV, Wiggins, Anunoby etc keep them respectably competitive while they help mentor the young stable of studs they have from this years draft.

Trade #3:  Change of scenery...

A little shell game with some of the leagues top stars.  Dame lands in Philly with Embiid forming a scary duo.  Siakam goes to Portland to team up with CJ and a squad that needed a little length come playoff time.  Toronto gets to try the Simmons rehab project stacking him next to FVV, OG and whatever young stud they get at #4 this year.  It's a rebuild without the rebuild.  Everyone wins.

However, I have a hard time seeing the difference when the Cavs had an iso-heavy offense that revolved around Lebron. The difference was that they had 3 point shooters that gave Lebron room to work with. The problem was the lack of defensive prowess when Lebron sat leading them to get outclassed (mainly by the Warriors) which is why the Lakers brought Vogel to help fix that problem.



So, is the lack of 3 point shooting that the Lakers have attributed to poor offensive coaching? The players simply not being able to open shots?

Steph has great shot creation and an ideal supporting cast (Klay obviously was huge) but he probably wouldn’t have reached his ceiling unless he was used in this particular way. 

That being said I came up with a few players from NBA history who could’ve possibly been the engine of a team similar to Curry Warriors. Curious for your thoughts and other possibilities. Basically looked for players with strong shooting splits who could’ve had the arcs of their careers changed by a few more 3PA. 

Ray Allen 
My favorite candidate. Has very good shooting splits with strong seasons for individual and team success (Seattle early 2000’s) aligning with 7-8 3PA’s. Also think the potential for a Rashard Lewis/Ray combo could have been a great fit for today’s offensive philosophies. I think Ray’s physical abilities could have been harnessed to support the shooting. Would love to see what his career would have been had an offense had been built around him at the beginning of his career rather than the not as efficient Glenn Robinson.

Steve Nash
Amazing shooting splits. Similar court vision and  skills. I think even Nash himself has mentioned that he would have been developed differently today. He shot solidly in the 40% from deep throughout his career but never took more than five attempts. A real tragedy.

Steph has great shot creation and an ideal supporting cast (Klay obviously was huge) but he probably wouldn’t have reached his ceiling unless he was used in this particular way. 

That being said I came up with a few players from NBA history who could’ve possibly been the engine of a team similar to Curry Warriors. Curious for your thoughts and other possibilities. Basically looked for players with strong shooting splits who could’ve had the arcs of their careers changed by a few more 3PA. 

Ray Allen 
My favorite candidate. Has very good shooting splits with strong seasons for individual and team success (Seattle early 2000’s) aligning with 7-8 3PA’s. Also think the potential for a Rashard Lewis/Ray combo could have been a great fit for today’s offensive philosophies. I think Ray’s physical abilities could have been harnessed to support the shooting. Would love to see what his career would have been had an offense had been built around him at the beginning of his career rather than the not as efficient Glenn Robinson.

Obviously trading for Ben Simmons was the trade that most media personalities and casual NBA fans were championing because it provided a player that could be concretely identified as a potential building block for years to come.

However, there is little doubt that such a trade would not have resulted in the Rockets getting the worst record in the regular season, allowing them to keep their pick.

Now that they have secured the young 'franchise cornerstone' player that so many people felt was a critical part of a Harden trade, does having a surplus of future picks to aid in further rebuilding make the chosen trade look more palatable?

**How much has your opinion of the trade changed after the results of the NBA draft lottery?**

I feel this result clearly tilts the scale in favor of the Nets trade not only being the best option, but being the best option by an ***incredibly large margin*** (especially given how far Ben Simmons stock has fallen in recent days).

Although not a part of the actual trade, the Nets option has now delivered Kevin Porter Jr. and a blue-chip prospect (likely Green or Mobley) to the Rockets under long-term cheap control to pair with solid young players like Wood, Tate, and KJ Martin. 

In 2 years, the Rockets will likely have enough cap space to sign 2 max free agents from what projects to be a loaded free agency class to join that young core.

And then they have a stockpile of other picks to add to it, too (second most behind OKC).

After retaining their pick the Rockets have easily become one of the 10 most promising 'future' teams in the NBA.","t3_o62q9j","https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/o62q9j/revisiting_the_harden_trade/",114,72,"t1_h2qfqhv","2021-22-06 9:25:19 PM","Six months later, the trade looks fine.

Here is some analysis on how tonight’s game might go in Atlanta.

The Bucks have seemed figure out how to fluster the Hawks on defense. They put pressure on Trae by eliminating his space off the PnR and helping off of the perimeter. This was a key adjustment from game 1 where Milwaukee looked to stay home and let Trae beat them off of high-percentage floater looks.

Atlanta has to get really creative on offense, and they need great production from either of their secondary scoring options (Huerter or Bogi). If Milwaukee continues to help off the perimeter (which they will), Huerter or Bogi should look to be aggressive scorers in order to make the Bucks pay.

Keep in mind, the result of Atlanta’s misses were primarily due to the Bucks defense rather than variance. To combat this, Atlanta should look to fix their spacing issues with the John Collins and Clint Capella pairing. Capella isn’t a shooter, so a Trae/JC PnR isn’t an effective game plan since Capella’s defender is gonna help in the paint. They can try to rely on the Trae/Capella PnR, but Milwaukee is going to continue to sell out and help off of JC. I expect Collins to put up a bunch of threes today.

Offensively, the Bucks still don’t have much to worry about. Maybe Atlanta can try the wall, but they have attempted this and their wall is effective with defenders Bogi and Gallo. Their perimeter defenders weren’t aggressive enough in cutting off Giannis’s driving lanes. If they are more aggressive, however, the Bucks should resort to putting Giannis in screener situations and open up scoring opportunities for Jrue/Middleton as ball handlers.

Milwaukee probably will not shoot as efficiently as they did in game 2. However, they did not sway the game from the shooting; it was the defense and Giannis being aggressive in the paint. Also, they lost by 40 points, that tells you they were outmatched on both sides of the ball.

I expect the Bucks to continue the aggressive help on Trae, which will open up opportunities for Atlanta’s wings. He should become more of a willing passer out of the PnR, and their wings will have more production offensively - the only question is if they can score at an efficient rate. Collins will attempt more three point shots since Giannis tends to help off of him.

"nbadiscussion","WordsAreSomethings","Shouldn't the Sixers trade Embiid instead of Simmons?","2021-28-06 10:30:43 AM","Okay, 

Controversial take: Joel Embiid is spectacular, a two way phenom, the reason the Sixers are good recently, and simply a player with an MVP type of ceiling. 

But with his injury history, are we sure the Sixers are making the right decision keeping him above Simmons?

Now no one could predict injuries, Embiid is still young, and a center of his caliber is literally impossible to find... 

But isn't that the point? Embiid would fetch a crazy high amount of picks and players if he was traded today, similar to the AD and Jrue Holiday and Paul George trades. Meanwhile, I imagine, Simmons wouldn't. 

So if you did trade Embiid -- who would you get back? Could you trade him for all of New York's assets and picks? or to Oklahoma for a good amount of their draft war chest? Would a team of Ben Simmons + high pick X + new young guy you traded for + Tyrese Maxey, who you assume wouldn't get traded + Tobias Harris eventually be better than what you could build around Embiid? Is Embiid so good that he's worth more risk? 

Meanwhile -- what do you get for Simmons exactly? Are you sure you're getting back a guy who helps you win now? Is that guy the short term answer for a finals appearance? And what if Simmons just improves immediately with a new team and coach?

So I'm just saying, maybe the Sixers should sell high on Embiid and do the quick retool around Simmons instead.","t3_o9p4iw","https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/o9p4iw/shouldnt_the_sixers_trade_embiid_instead_of/",0,9,"t1_h3cd7b5","2021-28-06 10:36:42 AM","No because the player would would hope to draft with those picks is Embiid.

"nbadiscussion","Tinman_T","Ranking OKC's First Round Picks","2021-25-06 9:27:44 AM","Everyone knows that OKC has a lot of draft capital. While it is typically reported that they have 17 FRPs over the next 7 years, they realistically have 18 since it is unlikely that their own 2022 FRP that they owe to Atlanta (lottery protected) will convey. Presti will certainly look to end up in the lottery again next year, which means that FRP will be retained and they will send out 2 of their 21 SRPs instead.

And the big reason that we can be certain that OKC will try to keep it in house is that it may well be the last 'good' chance they have to get a high-calibre pick that can be assured to draft in the top-10, which is where teams want to be in order to maximize their chances of getting a superstar through the draft.

Could that possibly be right?!? With so many future FRPs, the assumption would be that there will be lots of ping pong balls in the Thunder's future. But unless the Clippers or Philadelphia fall apart completely or Houston's rebuild takes longer than the Rockets hope, then OKC may well have nothing but their own picks to rely upon for a lottery presence; and with Shai in hand and an eye on hopefully taking advantage of future swap rights, one would expect that they try to stop tanking sooner rather than later (not to mention ownership and fans surely won't be happy if the rebuild starts to extend for too long).

Let's look at exactly what future FRPs the Thunder have and try to rank them into 3 tiers: Likely top-10 picks, likely mid-first picks (10-20), and likely late-first picks (20-30).

# Likely top-10 selections 

Here are the money picks:

2021 OKC - pick 6

2022 OKC - (lottery protected FRP currently owned by ATL)

**WHAT?** Is that seriously it?! You may disagree with my ranks, but I'm using ""likely"" as literally as possible. I'm not going to assume that the Clippers are ""likely"" to be horrible in 2024 or 2026. It is certainly possible that they could collapse and end up in the lottery, but as long as Ballmer is willing to spend and the franchise remains in LA with good management, I can't help but think they will find a way to remain 'playoff-competitive' at least.

The same is true for Philadelphia's 2025 FRP. They may well fall apart completely and not be able to stay within their protections (top 6 in '25, top 4 in '26, top 4 in '27), but Daryl Morey has always been good at his job and even with Embiid's injury concerns, I can't buy in to the idea that a top-10 selection is ""likely"". And if it does happen, it clearly won't be better than pick 5, which sort of mitigates the chances of getting a superstar at that spot.

The only other non-OKC chances that exist at a top-10 pick come from Houston's 2024 and 2026 selections. Considering where Houston is now, these may be the best chance the Thunder have, but by adding the second pick in a loaded draft to an already competitive young core, there is not a ""likely"" chance that these top-4 protected picks end up top 10. And if they do, it would probably be at the very tail end of that range. Losing out on this year's pick swap, which seemed to be just a free 48% shot at a superstar, may have been even worse than it looks at first glance if a guy like Jalen Green or Evan Mobley can pull Houston into the play-in tournament in a few years. But while I don't feel comfortable consigning these picks to this tier, they will absolutely appear high in the next one.

# Likely mid-first round picks

2021 BOS pick 16

2021 MIA pick 18

Obviously these two are already locked in to this range. Unlikely to see a future superstar come from these picks, but if Presti holds on to them (instead of using them in trades) there is a chance they could get a decent player or 2 given how deep this year's draft is. 

These future picks are in the order of which ones I am predicting to be the 'best' picks.

2023 OKC (unlikely swap with LAC)

2024 OKC

2024 HOU 

2025 PHI

2026 LAC

2023 MIA

2026 HOU

2024 LAC

Let's sub-divide this tier right here for a moment to talk about it. I'm assuming that OKC wants to start climbing out of the cellar by this point and has enough of a team to successfully do it considering how competitive they were this year before the tank was initiated. They likely want to get good to keep everyone happy and give fans some hope, as well as to take advantage of some of the swaps they have on future picks. But they certainly aren't likely to be a good team at this point. I don't see them being able to take advantage of the 2023 swap with the Clippers. These picks will probably land somewhere between 10-16, imo.

The Philly pick is one of the hardest to forecast. I'll drop it here, but I'm interested in what other people think about it.

As mentioned in the previous tier's final paragraph, Houston may not get to rebuild as quickly as they want to and this pick could still fall in the lottery. But there is absolutely no guarantee of that. and even less of a guarantee on the 2026 pick. 

For the unprotected Clippers picks, the chances of being high-quality go in reverse order as their stars age out. The 2026 pick may well be a gold mine. It could very well be the number 1 overall pick. PG and Kawhi will be quite old at this point if they are even still on the team, but if they aren't, there is a good chance that other stars will have lined up to play in Los Angeles for a really good owner. 

I'm projecting the Miami pick to be similar to what it was this year... late teens. Let me know if you disagree. Which means those 2 picks after it could very well end up in the next tier.

# Likely late-first round picks

So maybe those 2024 LAC and 2026 HOU picks will end up in the 20s somewhere, but I put them there in order to give OKC the benefit of the doubt. And I'll give them the benefit of the doubt here with their own picks. If all goes well, they should have had enough time to get into the playoffs again, but their own picks from 2025 on may well still be in the teens. Because as we are seeing... they really don't have a lot of great opportunities to draft stars unless they get lucky on some of their mid-first selections. It's very possible they don't escape mediocrity. But let's give them the benefit of the doubt that SGA becomes a top-20 player and Poku doesn't bust and say they have climbed into semi-contention by 2025.

2025 OKC (possible unprotected swap with LAC or HOU, top-10 protected)

2026 OKC

2027 OKC

2023 DEN (unlikely to be used lottery protection)

2022 LAC

2022 PHO (unlikely to be used protections)

So they have 3 picks coming up in the next couple years from teams that project to be very good. These picks are almost certain to land well after 20.

# Conclusion

So that's all 18 picks. I think I was pretty fair in my analysis (feel free to disagree), and if so it means that despite a great deal of quantity... I'm not seeing a whole lot of quality in OKC's pick futures. Outside of their own picks, there aren't any sure-fire top picks. In fact, ***there may not be a single lottery pick from another team in the whole bunch.***

Losing the final game of the season to the Clippers as well as the 'coin-flip' on the Houston swap may have really killed their chances to draft a generational superstar.

Even if they wanted to package picks to move up, they may not have enough juice to get very high in the draft simply because they might not have a good starting spot to bargain with after the next couple of years.

Presti will have to draft well from the middle of the draft, because those valuable top-4 selections that got the Thunder 3 MVPs so many years ago don't seem to be on the horizon.

Edit: I'm going to stop discussing things on this thread now since folks are just downvoting me and ignoring the fact that it's an obvious prediction, but are only countering my arguments of what I'm calling ""likely"" (with rationale as to why), with the low-effort responses of ""anything can happen""... As if I don't understand that.

Essentially any player coming out of a college within 50 miles of a team's home court could be drafted with a team's 1st round pick before the draft started. 

Here were my guidelines:

1. Player had to play within 50 miles of a team's home court to be drafted by them. Where they played college takes precedence first, but if their college wasn't within 50 miles of an NBA team, than they could be taken based on where they played their senior year of high school.

2. Teams actually had to have a first round pick that year. Without a 1st round pick, teams can't use a territorial pick.

3. If multiple teams could use a territorial pick on the same player, I went with the team that had the earlier pick.

4. Lastly, I only looked at HOF players that were at least top 15 draft picks. Obviously there would have been plenty of other picks too.

With all that said, here are my 25 HOF players from the past 30 years that would have been drafted by a different team if territorial picks were still around:

The list is Giannis, Luka, Kawhi, Bron, AD, Dame, Steph, Harden, Joker, KD, Embiid.

I posted on this sub a couple of weeks ago about the potential of Booker becoming a BPCT and after Trae’s run that he is having, I have the same elusive question. I think it’s accepted that there are 11 guys that are BPCT worthy, where if you put them on a team with another BPCT guy + anselory pieces (ex. Bron and AD) or a second-best guy with great role players (ex. Kawhi and PG) or a second and third guy with meh to crap role players (ex. Giannis, Jrue, Middleton), these are all theoretical Larry O’Brien worthy teams.

There are a few guys that I think are on the fringe of this tier right now but have arguments of why they haven’t accomplished what they “should have”: Embiid, Giannis, Dame, Harden, and AD. 

The first thing I thought about in regard to Trae is what does he have to do to rise to this top tier? I think we have to start with what all these guys have in common (this all theoretical and arguable). 

&#x200B;

1. If you throw two BPCT guys together (barring injury) they have to make the finals.
2. They have to be able to average at least 25 in the playoffs and be at least a neutral on defense.
3. They have to beat another BPCT guy on their way to, or in the Finals. 
4. At any point in time you can make an argument they are the best player in the world.

There might be more or less qualifiers, but I think this is sufficient. 

I think if Trae beats the Bucks you can make the argument he has gone above and beyond, going against three incredible defensive teams and two BPCT’s. This is where the argument starts because if he doesn’t beat Giannis the argument can’t be made IMO. (Side Note: If Giannis loses with a theoretically far better team, he gets moved out of this tier for me). After that, I think he has to at the very least have a 2019 Paul George type MVP next year where he is solidly in the race. Finally, he has to get to at least the second round next year.

To sum it up IMO for Trae to become a BPCT he has to beat Giannis, has an MVP-like season next year, and Get to the second round next year.","t3_o7reez","https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/o7reez/is_trae_a_best_player_on_a_championship_team_guy/",16,35,"t1_h30vvoo","2021-25-06 11:38:30 AM","I argued with someone on here a year ago about this.

It is unknown what substance was used or what the extent of its use was. Harris can apply for reentry into the league after a year.


So I ask the question, is this punishment fair? Players have been given say 30 game suspensions for PED use which in my eyes is more serious than say a one time use of cocaine or meth as it affects the product of an NBA game. The guy is only 22 and was only in the league for a year, showing lots of potential especially after dropping 31 points in a game against Dallas back in April. It seems to me that his career may have been ruined over a very minor infraction.


So what do you guys think? Was this deserved?

PEDs 100% will give you an advantage in basketball lmfao.  They can make you big and strong, which is the bit people are trying to argue isn't helpful in basketball (weird.)  I don't think you're getting how big and strong.  It's literal super human strength.  But also, PEDs can make you both fast/quicker and more importantly, give you better endurance.  They can make it much easier to play a 48 minute game.  PEDs will also wreck your body and lead to mental/emotional problems.  If the PED penalty is 30 days and the recreational drug penalty is a year+, then it seems like the NBA WANTS their players on PEDs.  They don't give a shit about players health.  Their drug policy is literally just about appeasing people with conservative values.  I also don't know the actual rules and am just trusting other comments in this thread lol. Now let's get to the hard drugs they are stigmitizing.  When you get injured, DOCTORS give you opiodes.  The NBA is stuffing their employees full of opiodes.  Opiodes are highly addictive..  It would be absolutely wild for the NBA to have a zero policy rule, considering this fact.  It's absolutely abhorrent for the NBA to not have some kind of short suspension/help you out program, at least for 1st offenses.  The NBA is literally forcing these drugs on these young men and its surprising more don't keep taking them when their prescriptions are up.  Once again, idk the real rules but am basing them on other comments. Adderall is an amphetamine and I'm sure a lot more of you have taken amphetamines than you're even aware.  LSD is definitely a recreation drug.  Cocaine CAN BE a recreational drug.  None of these should be one time you're done and a one time drug test doesn't mean abuse.  First test should definitely lead to a short suspensions, sit down, meet with a counselor at the least.  Also, as another comment brought up, alcohol can ruin your life just as bad, if not worse than all of these. I have no excuse for PCP.

#1. Would Houston accept this trade offer from Golden State for Christian Wood?

**Houston receives:** 

- James Wiseman, Mychal Mulder

- Picks #7 and #14 in this year's draft

**Golden State receives:**

- Christian Wood

This trade gives Houston a young player for the future in James Wiseman and 2 lottery picks in this year's draft (with Mulder included for salary cap reasons), and it gives Golden State a win-now center in Christian Wood, so they can have a starting line-up of Curry/Klay/Wiggins/Draymond/Wood. 

#2. Would San Antonio accept this offer from Los Angeles in a S&T for DeMar DeRozan?

**San Antonio receives:**

- Kyle Kuzma

- Pick #22 in this year's draft

**Los Angeles receives:**

- DeMar DeRozan

Los Angeles signs DeMar as a FA, so San Antonio gets Kyle Kuzma to see what he can do on a team that can actually develop its players, and a first round pick as the Lakers need to do a S&T to get DeMar as they don't have enough cap space. (This is a S&T, as DeMar, who is a FA, wants to go to the Lakers, so the Lakers have most of the power here)

#3. Would Philadelphia accept this trade offer from Portland for Ben Simmons?

**Philadelphia receives:**

- CJ McCollum

- Portland's 2022 1st (top-10 protected, if top 10, it becomes Portland's 2022 2nd)

**Portland receives:**

- Ben Simmons

The 76ers get a guard that can actually score, while the all-offense no-defense Blazers get great defender.

#4. Would Cleveland accept this trade offer from Miami for Collin Sexton?

**Cleveland receives:** 

- Tyler Herro, Precious Achiuwa, Andre Iguodala

**Miami receives:**

- Collin Sexton, Kevin Love

This is not my idea as I got this mock trade from an IG post.

#5. Would Cleveland accept this trade offer from Dallas for Collin Sexton?

**Cleveland receives:**

- Kristaps Porzingis, Josh Green

**Dallas receives:**

- Collin Sexton, Kevin Love

The Mavs get a scorer to put next to Luka, while the Cavs get a big in Tingus Pingus. (Ignore this if Houston takes Green over Mobley)

#6. Would Toronto accept this trade offer from Orlando for pick #4?

**Toronto receives:** 

- Picks #5 and #8 in this year's draft

- Chicago's 2023 1st via Orlando (top-4 protected, if top 4, it becomes Chicago's top-3 protected 2024 1st, and if that pick is top 3, it becomes Chicago's 2026 and 2027 2nds)

**Orlando receives:**

- Pick #4 in this year's draft

The Magic, who aren't great at developing players, can (presumably) draft a high floor prospect in Jalen Suggs, instead of having to settle for Jonathan Kuminga, who is a bit of a project. Meanwhile, the Raptors, who are the best team in the league at player development, (presumably) get Kuminga, the #8 pick for Masai to use, and a 2023 pick that could be very juicy if the LaVine/Vucevic experiment fails in Chicago.

#7. Would Cleveland accept this trade offer from New Orleans for Collin Sexton?

**Cleveland receives:** 

- Eric Bledsoe, Jaxson Hayes

- Picks #10 and #35 in this year's draft

- Los Angeles's 2022 1st via New Orleans

**New Orleans receives:**

- Collin Sexton, Kevin Love

The Cavs gets rid of the Kevin Love contract and take on the Bledsoe contract and get some picks and a young reclamation project in Jaxson Hayes, while the Pelicans get Collin Sexton and a veteran in Kevin Love (they reportedly want a veteran leader).","t3_oi8pz7","https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/oi8pz7/would_any_of_these_trade_packages_from_one_team/",11,21,"t1_h4vcnr3","2021-11-07 6:05:32 PM","1. Why would the Warriors offer this trade? Why would they give up all of their assets besides Wiggins (I guess you can count Oubre as an asset too, but we don’t know if Golden State will find a sign-and-trade for him) for a center who has never been an All-Star? If they’re gonna give up all of this they better be getting an All Star caliber player. They could probably get Wood for Wiseman and 14 straight up. Terrible trade for the Warriors 2. I remember back in 2016 there were some rumors that DeRozan wanted to go to the Lakers (and maybe he still does, because that’s where he’s from), but a lot can change in four years. We don’t necessarily know where he wants to go at this point in time. The free agent who is signing the contract always has the power in a sign-and-trade, so if DeRozan doesn’t want to go to LA, than the deal is off. Additionally, this trade wouldn’t even work due to salary cap rules (DeRozan is going to get a lot more on the open market than the $13M that Kuzma is making plus the salary of the 22nd pick which is gonna be like 2-4 million). Maybe if you included KCP or Harrell in this trade, this trade would be enough for the Spurs to accept, since this is better than losing DeRozan for nothing, but there might be a contending team that is over the cap that offers an even more lucrative sign and trade offer. This is on top of the fact that the Lakers would be adding DeMar DeRozan to one of the worst three point shooting teams in the NBA. Terrible trade. 3. If anything, the Sixers would have to be the ones giving up picks in this deal. But that might not even be enough for the Blazers. Why would a win now team trade their second best player for a younger player (who is worse in the short term) and picks? What good does that do for a team with a star player that is going to be 31 in a couple days and is trying to win now? Even if the Blazers were trying to blow it up and did this trade with the intention of trading Damian Lillard later on, Ben Simmons has a pretty extensive injury history and, even though he’s 24, hasn’t gotten any better since his rookie season. Portland would not accept this deal.  4. Actually not a bad trade. The Heat get a two guard who is better and more consistent in the areas that Tyler Herro is good at plus a much better defender. The Cavs get someone who is under team control for two more years as opposed to Sexton’s one year and will probably make significantly less in 2022-23 than Sexton. And they’re saving a ton of money trading Love for Iguodala. The Cavs would be saving like 70 million over the next two seasons. Assuming that the Cavs don’t want to give Collin Sexton the max (which is safe to assume considering all reports point to that being the case) and the Heat do, this trade would be accepted by both teams. 5. This trade looks good to me. I don’t really have that much to say about it. It ain’t nothing special but it’s a solid trade 6. Idk why the Magic would trade the fifth pick plus the eighth pick to move up one spot in the draft. Would rather have two chances at drafting a star player than one, even if the Magic aren’t good at developing players.  7. What are the Cavs accomplishing by taking on the big fat contract of Eric Bledsoe? Even worse, what are the Pelicans accomplishing by taking on the massive Kevin Love contract? They already have a crowded frontcourt. They can sign a veteran leader at a position they need even more for WAY less. Overall, Sexton to the Pelicans is a solid idea, but there are much better trade packages out there.",-1,0.048,0.799,0.154,0.9977,3.04

HOU would accept but there’s probably zero chance GSW actually offers all of this. This is basically every good asset they have. Reminder they’re out a future 1st to MEM that blocks them from trading other 1sts so they’d REALLY have to strike out on every other trade option. 2. I’d probably say no for SA, Kuzma seems like the polar opposite of their type of player. Also there’s potential hard-cap issues with LAL depending on how much DeRozan signs for, which might prevent them from keeping Caruso and Schroeder and may require dumping Harrell if he opts into his player option. 3. I’d put this at a coin flip, PHI probably asks for more or holds out for Dame/Beal to come available. 4. I think CLE says yes here, but if (big IF) they really don’t want to pay Sexton in RFA. Also I’d have to expect Iguodola to immediately demand a trade out of CLE. He didn’t want to play for MEM all last year 5. If the MIA offer is real I like that one better for CLE. This one feels neutral overall with a longer contract coming back in KP who might want to leave DAL but does he really want to play in CLE? 6. If Green and Mobley are gone then TOR jumps on this. This also feels like an overpay for one spot - 5+8 or 5+the CHI pick should be enough. It only cost PHI and DAL an additional first each to move up 2 spots 7. Does Kevin Love *really* count as a veteran leader the way he’s gone out in CLE this past year? Getting two 1sts for Sexton and saving a bunch of money this year and next is worth it IMO so they say yes here. This seems like the wrong direction for NOP - I’d have them trading 10 to IND for Myles Turner, and then salary dumping Adams/Bledsoe with future picks to keep Lonzo (Hart seems like a goner).",13,0.071,0.766,0.163,0.9873,4.63

For me, I thought the Bucks did a lot better than G1 and their defence was really solid. They did let a couple of open 3s slip but the main nail in their coffin was Booker hitting 4 (maybe more?) highly contested 3s over taller defenders like it was nothing. That really slowed the Bucks 3rd quarter into 4th comeback and kept Suns far ahead. 

Jrues d was excellent but I just don't understand why he's playing or treated like the go-to guy early in the game in so many of their games, is it because he needs that to stay motivated? If Giannis was the one pushing early (and likely making more than Jrue) they might have been able to pull further away in the first. In contrast, I felt like Khris had a pretty quiet game, I see he was 5-16 but it didn't really feel like he was shooting much at all when watching.","t3_ogsdzc","https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/ogsdzc/takes_on_finals_g2/",20,8,"t1_h4rv7vl","2021-10-07 8:49:16 PM","Once again, the Bucks go away from what's working as the game wears on. In Game 1, they were making the Suns pay for their lack of size by getting Brook Lopez easy buckets inside, and in Game 2 they were also making the Suns pay for their lack of size by all aggressively attacking the basket. It's not a matter of the Suns adjusting and eventually stopping it, it really is Milwaukee going away from a tactic that is working, and I don't know why they're doing it? Are players whinging in-game, and wanting to play a different way, and coaches caving, despite the original tactic working? Are the players just not mentally strong or smart enough to stick to the gameplan? What is it?",1,0.153,0.788,0.058,-0.8401,2.08

For this definition, something like a Clutch Score stat should be made. It's like the Game Score, but it only accounts for Clutch plays.

●If a player makes a game winner/equalizer, that is a plus point in Clutch Score.

●If a player misses the game winner/equalizer, that is a minus point in Clutch Score.

●If a player blocks a game winner/equalizer, that is a plus point.

●If a player makes an assist for the game winner/equalizer, this is also a plus point.

There are other metrics that could still be added, but I think Clutch Score could tell us  which player we should trust for game winning situations.

In 1954-55 and 1955-56, Chuck Share started at center for the Hawks, so Pettit was PF. In 1956-57, they brought in Ed Macauley but still had Share there, so a common starting lineup involved Pettit at SF, Macauley at PF, and Share at center, although Auerbach always defended him with Russell regardless. In 1957-58, Hagan burst onto the scene and the Hawks frontcourt became Hagan at SF, Pettit at PF, and Macauley at C. In 1958-59, Macauley began to severely slow down and Share returned to the starting center spot, but Hagan remained at SF and Pettit at PF. The next season, Lovellette went from sixth man to starting center and Share was benched and eventually traded away. That made the lineup Hagan at SF, Pettit at PF, and Lovellette at center, which remained the Hawks' starting frontcourt from 1959-60 to 1961-62. Lovellette was sold to Boston in the summer of 1962, but they drafted Zelmo Beaty, who started at center for St. Louis for the rest of Pettit's career. There's only a single year where he wasn't primarily a PF, and that was a weird circumstance where he was pushed out of position because the coach wanted to try a Twin Towers duo but obviously couldn't bench Pettit.",1,0.032,0.906,0.062,0.7272,2.12
"nbadiscussion","Camctrail","8 observations from this post-season.","2021-24-06 11:23:22 AM","1. Big Ball vs Small Ball centers
   1. One of things that was interesting was how in 2020, it was a season of small ball centers taking center stage. Bam Adebayo helped sink the Celtics. Anthony Davis was a defensive force. The Rockets bet the farm on PJ Tucker. All these dudes, outside Davis, were legit small for the center, while Davis is skinny. All of them had some level of success.
   2. In 2021 though, arguably what we're seeing is the rise of Big ball centers -- guys with some offensive skills but whose role is really to play D and PLAY BIG. Three of the four teams left count on guys who are Big Ball centers -- Ayton, whose a mobile 7 footer and the talk of the playoffs, Lopez, a sweet shooting big man who can box out and defend well, and Clint Capela, whose as close to a poor man's clone of Dwight Howard as any in the league. This is a big difference than from last year. I'm defining the big ball center by what they do on D not O, btw. 
2. Superstar/Hybrid Centers have done well this playoffs, but if you ask them to do too much on offense, you didn't get out of the second round
   1. The common thread of KD, Embiid and Jokic. KD saw his teammates go down and him step up to play big and score, setting up the offense. He did amazing. It wasn't enough, eliminated. Embiid had to also be the last line of defense, play big and set up his offense. It was too much, eliminated. Jokic saw his teammates go down, play big and set up his offense. MVP of the regular season, but that's too much, eliminated. If you compare this to Giannis, whose job was to play D reasonably well while also leading the offense, but not be the entirety of the defense at the rim and doing defensive rebounding, you see why he's still standing. It's going to be a while before we see a Shaq in 2000 performance ever again, something that should make us appreciate that ALOT more. 
3. Rudy Gobert took the heat for Utah losing, but the reality is is that injuries caught up to the team's guards. 
   1. We all just like to make fun of him and it's okay, he should gain a thicker skin. This one's been done ad nauseam. Just remember -- to lose a 26 point lead, both your defense and offense must fail, and considering Reggie Jackson and Terrance Mann suddenly went super saiyan, from all over the court, while Don Mitchell just couldn't score anymore, I put that lost squarely on the guards of the team, and then on Rudy. Wouldn't be shocked if their injuries are worse than we think.
4. The Suns are a young team but play like an old team, they don't turn the ball over that much and that will likely be a big reason they beat the Clippers, if they beat the Clippers.
   1. When I predicted the Lakers to go over the Suns in the first round, I was relying on old logic -- young teams don't win, even in wacky seasons. Well, that's because young teams have a tendency to self combust, turning the ball over under pressure, not knowing who should shoot on the last play, having some chemistry issues, etc. That and the Lakers thrived off teams turning the ball over last season, turning Russell Westbrook's dribbling into a liability, something that led to transition and then AD putting the other team in foul trouble. Well... I was wrong! The Suns have legit none of those issues of young teams and are pretty careful with the basketball! One wonders if this due to CP3 being a basketball wizard and changing his approach with age and playing on that OKC team last season. I genuinely believe this is the net effect of CP3, he's one of those beyond the box score leader types. 
5. Injuries had a big effect, but so do role players stepping up.
   1. People will write about this 1000x here so I'm not going to add anything. Have at it.
6. Ben Simmons scraped by on potential and now that's simply not good enough.
   1. 10 years ago, Ben Simmons would've played like Rajon Rondo, and would have been expected to have similar levels of success to Rondo. This legit wasn't that long ago, Rondo was phenomenal for a while and the league isn't fully in ""everyone must shoot"" mode until the Warriors first chip, though teams were experimenting. We still have players that are relics of that era, though increasingly, they're less effective. 
   2. As his season is now over, it's time to assess Ben Simmons and the role of ""non shooting, defense first point guards."" One surmises that a point guard who can't shoot, can't effectively do his job despite being 6'10, because the defense sags back in the playoffs. This isn't so much an issue if you're going to be running at the basket all the time in transition. The thing with playoff ball is that, transition opportunities get limited by teams suddenly playing much more carefully with the ball.
   3. This then begs the question, are we simply miscasting Ben Simmons as a point guard now? Is he ACTUALLY a point guard or is he... a point forward or small ball 5? I think this is the major question surrounding Simmons, which is A) what is he and B) how much should he be enabled by teams (the Westbrook question). It doesn't take a genius to see he's probably needing a rethinking of what he can do by someone. 
7. Trae Young, Kawhi Leonard, Luka Doncic, Kevin Durant, Donovan Mitchell, Devin Booker are keeping Kobe's memory alive even better than the 2020 Lakers did, by shooting from the midrange so effectively. 
   1. Arguably, this should be the least shocking thing about the playoffs -- when the clock ticks down and the balls in the superstars hands, their job is to make silly, ridiculous shots, like Kobe did, like Wade did, like Jordan did, etc. The midrange is the superstars shot, it's the shot they get paid for, and I just listed 6 guys who having that midrange in the game is probably lifting them past their peers. 
8. The Hawks vs Bucks is a major question of winning in the NBA -- is defense or offense more important? 
   1. The Hawks are a better offensive team that is an okay defensive team. Capela helps. But you know, their best defense is shooting and making shots, kinda like the old Rockets were.
   2. The Bucks are a staunch SLOW IT DOWN AND TRY TO SCORE ON US defensive team, with some shooters to keep the game close if the other team is scoring a lot or make the game get out of hand if the opponent can't score at all. They have four good defenders in the starting lineup, and in a way, somewhat resemble the 2020 Lakers, only Middleton is in the AD free safety role.
   3. I don't know who would win, my prediction even after game 1 is this is a knockdown dragout series, but there's legit two philosophies on the floor, and if the Bucks win it would match my perception that BAD ASS D wins titles. But they also could not win. I don't know. 
9. The teams left standing all have a combination of young guys and veterans, affirming what I, a know nothing fan, have always believed in was the championship formula.
   1. Whether its the Hawks with Gallinari, Bucks with Jrue, Clippers with Reggie Jackson, or the Suns with CP3, the impact of guys with 10 plus year careers in the league can often be felt in that even if they're bad, they provide some steadiness in the playoffs. Arguably these guys have bigger roles than they had, getting their big contracts, outside Reggie Jackson. Always important to note is whose got a team built like this, IMO.","t3_o76t0q","https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/o76t0q/8_observations_from_this_postseason/",7,4,"t1_h2xg85f","2021-24-06 2:01:05 PM","It's not necessarily big boy centers who are making a comeback, it's big boy centers who can ALSO hang with perimeter players on defense.

So, as you can see, Ayton's run stacks up favorably in all four categories. Obviously he's getting lots of easy buckets from lobs/rim runs/put backs, but it's still incredibly impressive. Let's hope he keeps it up the rest of the way and that there's even better runs from him still to come!

Here is some analysis on how tonight’s game might go in Atlanta.

The Bucks have seemed figure out how to fluster the Hawks on defense. They put pressure on Trae by eliminating his space off the PnR and helping off of the perimeter. This was a key adjustment from game 1 where Milwaukee looked to stay home and let Trae beat them off of high-percentage floater looks.

Atlanta has to get really creative on offense, and they need great production from either of their secondary scoring options (Huerter or Bogi). If Milwaukee continues to help off the perimeter (which they will), Huerter or Bogi should look to be aggressive scorers in order to make the Bucks pay.

Keep in mind, the result of Atlanta’s misses were primarily due to the Bucks defense rather than variance. To combat this, Atlanta should look to fix their spacing issues with the John Collins and Clint Capella pairing. Capella isn’t a shooter, so a Trae/JC PnR isn’t an effective game plan since Capella’s defender is gonna help in the paint. They can try to rely on the Trae/Capella PnR, but Milwaukee is going to continue to sell out and help off of JC. I expect Collins to put up a bunch of threes today.

Offensively, the Bucks still don’t have much to worry about. Maybe Atlanta can try the wall, but they have attempted this and their wall is effective with defenders Bogi and Gallo. Their perimeter defenders weren’t aggressive enough in cutting off Giannis’s driving lanes. If they are more aggressive, however, the Bucks should resort to putting Giannis in screener situations and open up scoring opportunities for Jrue/Middleton as ball handlers.

Milwaukee probably will not shoot as efficiently as they did in game 2. However, they did not sway the game from the shooting; it was the defense and Giannis being aggressive in the paint. Also, they lost by 40 points, that tells you they were outmatched on both sides of the ball.

I expect the Bucks to continue the aggressive help on Trae, which will open up opportunities for Atlanta’s wings. He should become more of a willing passer out of the PnR, and their wings will have more production offensively - the only question is if they can score at an efficient rate. Collins will attempt more three point shots since Giannis tends to help off of him.

Overall, my prediction is the Bucks win somewhere around 10-15, with another big game from Jrue and Middleton getting into a groove. Let me know how you think this one goes!","t3_o94wng","https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/o94wng/bucks_vs_hawks_game_3_analysis_predictions_things/",145,8,"t1_h39cbj5","2021-27-06 3:32:10 PM","Assuming the Bucks force the Hawks to beat them with Bogi, it will be an interesting experiment to see how effective he is in a high stakes scenario, especially since he was supposed to be on the Bucks.

I wanted to see if you guys agree with me.

1. Giannis is a Center. He's like a better version of Ayton in Phoenix. Giannis should not be the focal point of the offence. He's too limited. I say move him to the 5 and find shooting 4 that can spread the floor for Giannis in transition but can also rebound down low. Move Lopez to bench or trade?
2. Chris Middleton- I think he might be a better player than he is showing. I would make him a featured option. I think the consistency of being a #1 will do wonders for his game.
3. Jrue Holiday. I love him as a player. His defense is amazing. Did you see him block Ayton's dunk straight up?  I do think the Bucks are asking him to do too much offensively. I would move Jrue to the 2 and bring in an aggressive minded scoring guard to offset.

Giannis does have some limitations but it takes either an elite big man defender with strength and quickness to guard him, or you need to form a wall with multiple defenders. You have to gameplan your entire defense around him. He may not be suited as the “closer” but he’s been dominant these playoffs, he can absolutely be the primary scorer. The adjustment I think his game needs is to move him off ball more and utilize him as a screener/cutter more often, and also improve his midrange game to prevent teams from just forming a wall. Of course that would require having more playmakers on the team, which they don’t have.  Khris isn’t consistent enough to be a #1, he’s better suited as a secondary scorer and closer.  I agree on Jrue, his best seasons have been when he’s had another guard to share playmaking responsibilities with, he’s more of a secondary playmaker than a primary.  I do think they could use a better coach but that’s a lot easier said than done; Bud’s not elite but he’s absolutely a good coach.",3,0.009,0.784,0.207,0.9909,3.57

For anyone who doesn't know what RAPM is, it basically looks at a player's plus-minus every single possession of every single game over the time frame, and then adjusts it based on who his teammates were on the floor and who the defenders were on the floor, and adds it all up in some complex statistical analysis to estimate a player's impact. **There's no box score stats whatsoever when calculating RAPM.**

Long-term multiyear RAPM is considered the gold standard of NBA advanced stats and all modern advanced stats are built upon it. Since it's an objective calculation using solely plus-minus on a possession by possession basis with no box score stats whatsoever, it's considered the least biased way to evaluate a player's impact. Of course, no stat is without its faults, and even this 10 year time frame can underrate players who were developing in the beginning (like Dirk, Chris Paul, Lebron) or aging at the end (Tim Duncan, Ray Allen). Also just to note that this is only regular season over this time frame. 

Here's the source: https://sites.google.com/site/rapmstats/10-year-rapm. I only wanted to look at offense for this post. 

Tied 1st: Kobe Bryant/Lebron James, 

2nd: Dwayne Wade, 

3rd: Steve Nash, 

4th: Chris Paul, 

5th: Manu Ginobli, 

6th: Baron Davis, 

7th: Antawn Jamison, 

8th: Jason Kidd, 

Tied 9th: Dirk Nowitzki/Ray Allen, 

10th: Chauncey Billups

Anything interesting from these rankings? Anything that pops out? I think pertaining to Kobe Bryant the results are interesting as often in the current day there seems to be some people who portray Kobe Bryant as an inefficient scorer compared to other all-time greats when in reality his offensive impact was unparalleled during his time. His shot creation ability on very high volume on good efficiency along with his playmaking was clearly extremely efficient offense. Seeing Baron Davis here is also a big surprise. Ginobli is also somewhat surprising but most people who watched him play can attest to just how potent his offense was. He was James Harden before James Harden. 

Seeing guys like Antawn Jamison, Baron Davis, Jason Kidd ranked above Dirk (I must add that they're very slightly above him) is a headscratcher, but when you look at a 6 year RAPM from 2006 to 2011, Dirk's offense is ranked 3rd, so clearly Dirk had improved a ton from 2002 to 2006.  

Something that I thought was interesting to note was that Antawn Jamison was a TERRIBLE defender despite the elite offense. Despite being 7th in offensive RAPM, his total RAPM was ranked in 52 because of his terrible defense. 

And of course Lebron James tied at 1st also is interesting but not too surprising. Crazy when this time frame also includes his first two years when he was still developing, AND most of this time frame is before his true prime.

"nbadiscussion","WhiteNoiseReddit","Stars that may be traded that may be surprising.","2021-09-07 2:44:45 PM","This summer, with the free agency market lacking big time, it seems likely most teams will try to improve via the draft or trade.

And while this draft has some legit star talent at the top you may see one or two teams trade a older star to get, most will try to get a star from a trade.

I was working out who may be available, including people we may not expect. We have all heard about maybe Simmons or Lillard and Beal seems like he'll be an option, at least in people's heads, so if any of them got traded it really wouldn't be too surprising.

So the question became: **Is there anyone who has an actual possible shot of being traded (i.e. not Doncic nonsense trades) that may not be someone people expect but - in a market that may see teams bidding against each other and thus, driving up prices on talent - could still be dealt?**

Here's a list of people I think qualify for this:

- **KAT**

**Why yes**: The Wolves have been/are perpetually kind of a mess. I'm not sure where I'd rank KAT in the NBA, atm, but I can see a team talking themselves into his potential to improve (whether its there or not). 

The Wolves may decide to truly blow everything up and shed salary as they try to sell the team. Also, with all that's happened in his life during the pandemic, he may just want a change of scenery.

**Why no**: He may like the low-key nature of Minny, and with all that has happened in his life, he may enjoy playing with his friend D-Lo more than leaving for somewhere else. Also, while a lot of new owners like blowing things up, KAT is still young enough to be a building block.

**Possible teams**:

**Knicks** - They have Mitch, but I think KAT has more potential and it would allow him to be closer to his hometown. It could be a move for the Knicks where they get someone with star potential without having to give up the farm.

**Jazz** - Jazz don't usually make flashy moves, but I think him and Gobert could coexist without getting in each other's way too much. KAT may like playing PF too and the Jazz could provide some franchise stability. It'd be a bit of an old-school lineup but sometimes going against the grain can surprise teams. Engles could be flexed where needed as well.

**Washington** - The Wizards thinking they are closer to conention than they are and deciding to keep everyone AND deciding to give up way too much for KAT wouldn't even register as surprising to me.

- **Jrue Holiday**

**Why yes**: While Jrue did well for them, if they don't like how the Finals go down and can package him in a deal for a better player, they may go for it.

**Why no**: He has played well for them during the season, and the Bucks would likely make a coaching change before overhauling big parts of the roster. Also, sunk cost fallacy.

**Possible teams**:

**Blazers** - This would be an improvement. Blazers could take him on as part of a package and figure to trade him later or try to contend still now. Lillard with Giannis and Middleton would be scary, but issue is what else can Bucks give at this point in a trade?

**Depth** - I'm putting this here to encompass a number of possibilities with the basic idea being that maybe they can get 3 players that, while none are as good as Jrue, together they can help the team more.

- **Chris Paul**

**Why yes**: The Suns may end up winning the title, but Chris isn't getting younger and if some team wants to throw $100 mil.+ at him, the Suns may be appreciative of his help but not stupid.

With Booker, Bridges, Ayton, the Suns will be contenders still in the future, especially if they can get a decent haul. With a sign and trade, Paul could go to a team he wants, even if they don't have the cap room to get him in free agency.

Sarver may not want to pay high-dollar for their core 4.

**Why no**: Umm, the Suns are two games from the their first Finals victory ever. It's easy to assume the  Suns young talent will continue to improve, but it's not always a given, and so why screw things up now?

**Possible teams**:

**Knicks** - He's expressed desire to play their before and he could really help them make a deeper playoff push. If he's willing to take a 3 yr deal for say 90 mil., and the Knicks don't have to give up more than a couple of assets, I could see this being possible for them.

**Bucks** - Remember what I said about the Jrue improvement? This could be a way to improve with the limited assets Bucks still have.

**Lakers** - I don't think the Lakers can be ruled out this off-season from big moves, and it wouldn't surprise me if Paul hits that sweet spot of they have enough to get him/him being a big help for the team.

Though, it's possible the Suns don't want to help a title rival, they may also recognize that rival would be  built in part around some admittedly older stars.

- **Siakam**

**Why yes**: This goes back to what I said at the start; while the Raptors may not be inclined to trade him, if enough teams want to get stupid about it, they may decide he has platued and it's worth it to trade him while they can get so much.

**Why no**: It may just be he's better as a 2nd star and the Raptors like the core they have and want to build with him still, because again, despite any narratives atm, he's really good.

**Possible teams**:

**Warriors** - We've seen the rumored offer, but it really depends on how much the Raptors like Wiseman.

**Mavs** - I could see Dallas sending 4 firsts or more and Kristaps to get him in the type of move other contenders have made for stars. Would it be the right move for them? Ehhh, maybe?

While Kemba, Kristaps, McCollum all may be traded, they aren't on the level of the others above.

One team to watch out for: **The Hawks**.

The Hawks are ready to take the leap but are superstar hunting at this point, and have the assets to do so. I think they wait though until next off-season and see if the situations with Embiid, Giannis, or Doncic implode first before making all-in move.

"nbadiscussion","ilikedthismovie","Thoughts on Game 1 - 2021 Finals?","2021-07-07 7:07:55 AM","Strangely, there is no thread here, or nothing already posted.

I'm not going to pretend like I have some unique things to say, but I do have some thoughts, and hopefully other's have more insightful things to say.  

First, the Suns' guard tandem really shows the value of the midrange, even in this age of efficiency.  When defenses get tougher in the playoffs/finals, and when there is more time to game plan and prepare, the easy buckets and threes often get taken away, and having one, or even two players who can use screens, get mismatches, or even iso up and get to spots in the midrange and score is invaluable.  

Second, Giannis looked healthy, but completely disappeared for most of the game after a strong first quarter.  Suddenly, with 4 minutes left and the game pretty much out of reach, he became super active and energetic.  Very disappointing game for him, and for the Bucks, who just seem to be much more a great regular season team/average playoff team.  Giannis' game just is too limited it seems, he's got no versatility, and really looked like he didn't want to go the line.  Bud is at fault here too.  Giannis, not coincidently, was active (if not good, maybe) when Bud finally went to him as a center and played a small ball line up.  It was too little, too late, but we'll see it again if Bud is smart, so maybe we'll see it.  

Third, CP3 and Booker were really hunting mismatches on big men and feasting on them.  Bud either needs to change his defensive scheme, or play more Giannis at the 5, but that really seems like something Giannis can only do in spurts.  Paul was amazing in these matchups and really looked in full control of the game from the second quarter on.  We may see the worst contract in sports win the Finals MVP.","t3_ofjltq","https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/ofjltq/thoughts_on_game_1_2021_finals/",53,25,"t1_h4d4m2x","2021-07-07 8:39:30 AM","Bucks should have gone small earlier, unless bud is brain dead we will see a lot of that sooner. Lopez on the floor is a practically uncontested shot wherever cp3 or booker want it. Ayton is bigger than Giannis but Giannis can stay in front of him; Giannis needs to play the 5. Ayton had probably 8-10 points on oops when a guard switched on him after Lopez switched onto cp3 or book, it was unacceptable defense.  Jrue was bad bad. He needs to be competent for the bucks to win. Circling back to the first point, bucks going small puts jrue on one of cp3 or booker for longer. If he isn’t going on the offensive end, he needs to add value on the defensive end.  Booker wasn’t good but made 10fts. Don’t want to throw the refs under the bus but I do think there were some soft calls in the first half that overwhelmingly favored the suns. It’s hard to say this won the game for the suns, but if you’re calling playoff basketball no fouls on one end and then soft calls on the other end, it is understandingly frustrating.

It was laughable how easily PHX was getting whatever they wanted in the 3rd and him just letting the lead balloon like that. Middleton getting hot from beyond the arc kept them in it, but that's no recipe for success long term in this series. Giannis looking less than 100% is also giving them very little to work with. They are going to get absolutely crushed by the CP3/Booker tandem just forcing those switches and making them pay all series long.  And we already know that the Bucks are damn near incapable of doing the same thing based on this postseason. The Bucks being a really dumb team is going to come to full fruition here; there's no way that Chris Paul is letting this opportunity slip away if he's healthy enough to play throughout this series. Both he and Booker are way too good as playmakers to swarm them, the Suns have great perimeter shooting throughout, and Ayton is always available for easy finishes and cuts to the rim once the defense collapses.

Here is the link to the preview : https://twitter.com/basketlemag/status/1414618600279887880
(the small text is not on the same subject though - so don't bother translating)

For context, Xavier Vaution is the ""boss"" of the NBA team working at BeIN Sports, the french official NBA broadcaster. The article states that audiences have doubled since last year, while in the same time we are often seeing awful TV scores on ESPN / TNT broadcasts.

Before subscribing to beIN sports (15$/month), I was usually watching the games at 1am on free websites either broadcasting ESPN or TNT, it was my only way to watch NBA back then because I was too cheap to subscribe. 

The amount of commercials in the games really made it unwatchable. To give you perspective, beIN Sports only run 3 mn commercial pauses at the end of each quarter, so it's basically 10mn of commercials on a 2h15 game. 

When US audience is watching Chris Paul in a State Farm commercial,Blake Griffin fooling around in an other or big fat Burgers with a shit ton of calories, beIN Sports analyzes the game with former players (Mahinmi, Micoud (from Georgetown, etc..)), shows 10 mn interviews with NBA players or former ones (ex: QRich, Jet Terry..etc) , fools around with funny Q/A games.. etc..

That was just some positive feedback I had to give to the few NBA broadcasters loving the game and not ruining it with shitty commercials,and I'm quite lucky to be able to enjoy it, but I feel really sorry for ESPN or TNT subscribers (Shaq and Chuck are funny, but TNT is still more Burger/Toyota/Verizon than Chuck/Shaq overall)

Sorry for the bad english overall, but I felt I had to share.

I won't jump to any conclusion on anything because I don't know the topic enough, it's just that I think the NBA product is not suffering from impopularity, it's just not entertaining anymore to watch when there are that many commercials.","t3_oiypio","https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/oiypio/vaution_bein_sports_audiences_have_doubled_in_one/",7,2,"t1_h4zzvqr","2021-12-07 8:42:30 PM","Thanks for sharing this.

I know refs don’t always call all violations-traveling and 3 second rules come to mind. But watching refs hold the ball, ready to go, until Giannis finishes his pantomime free throw practice, and then almost never calling a violation when his shots go over 10 seconds is astonishing to me.  I don’t watch every game, so maybe they have cut others this same slack, but I haven’t seen anything like it in any game I’ve watched this year.  In that sense, the failure of the refs to follow the rule is uniquely benefiting a single team, and is therefore not the same as the laxity in the rules listed above, where they don’t strictly apply the rule even as most teams show violations. That’s a random following of the rule; this allowance for Giannis is a specific act that is repeated multiple times a game.  It also seems like the ref standing and waiting for Giannis to be ready, while everyone else on the court is ready and waiting, constitutes a delay of game. A player or coach would certainly get dinged for that kind of delay, wouldn’t they?  Even a recent nba last 2 minute report listed two 10 sec violations as Incorrect NonCalls. How are the referees allowed to continue exhibiting such bias in favor of only one team in their refusal to follow this rule for this single player?  I’ve seen arguments that they won’t change now because they set precedent throughout the season-that would work if this happened across the board to most teams, but it doesn’t. It is a delay of game, committed willfully and repeatedly by refs, to the benefit of a single player and a single team.  What is the rationale for refs causing a delay of game and exhibiting clear bias with their refusal to enforce this rule?",1,0.099,0.798,0.103,-0.2127,2.5300000000000002

I know refs don’t always call all violations-traveling and 3 second rules come to mind. But watching refs hold the ball, ready to go, until Giannis finishes his pantomime free throw practice, and then almost never calling a violation when his shots go over 10 seconds is astonishing to me.  I don’t watch every game, so maybe they have cut others this same slack, but I haven’t seen anything like it in any game I’ve watched this year.  In that sense, the failure of the refs to follow the rule is uniquely benefiting a single team, and is therefore not the same as the laxity in the rules listed above, where they don’t strictly apply the rule even as most teams show violations. That’s a random following of the rule; this allowance for Giannis is a specific act that is repeated multiple times a game.  It also seems like the ref standing and waiting for Giannis to be ready, while everyone else on the court is ready and waiting, constitutes a delay of game. A player or coach would certainly get dinged for that kind of delay, wouldn’t they?  Even a recent nba last 2 minute report listed two 10 sec violations as Incorrect NonCalls. How are the referees allowed to continue exhibiting such bias in favor of only one team in their refusal to follow this rule for this single player?  I’ve seen arguments that they won’t change now because they set precedent throughout the season-that would work if this happened across the board to most teams, but it doesn’t. It is a delay of game, committed willfully and repeatedly by refs, to the benefit of a single player and a single team.  What is the rationale for refs causing a delay of game and exhibiting clear bias with their refusal to enforce this rule?",1,0.099,0.798,0.103,-0.2127,2.5300000000000002

For most of his time on the Royals, their starting center was no taller than 6'8 and there was rarely ever a rotation player on the team taller than 6'9.  During his era more than any other era, team defense was mostly about rim protection and paint denial, yet the Royals were by far consistently the worst in the league on defense throughout his tenure. Oscar himself wasn't much of a defensive threat either but there's only so much a point guard can do to impact team defense. Reading and watching this [analysis](https://backpicks.com/2017/12/21/backpicks-goat-12-oscar-robertson/) from Ben Taylor, Oscar's defense was fairly neutral and average for a point guard. And even if it was below average it didn’t matter much because his offense was so ridiculously efficient and productive for his era. But unfortunately the Royal's overall team defense was horrid throughout his entire tenure save for one season. It's sad to think what could have been the perception of Oscar's career if he didn't win the championship his first season after leaving the Royals. Sometimes situations like these should make us reevaluate ring culture and look at the context for why certain players failed to achieve playoff success.

Regardless, any agreements or disagreements about the Royals' failure in providing Oscar a decent defense throughout 10 years being the greatest waste of a hall of fame talent in NBA history?","t3_od9pat","https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/od9pat/oscar_robertsons_cincinnati_royals_throughout_his/",494,87,"t1_h3zaycx","2021-03-07 6:48:38 PM","Give him a more defensive-orientated roster and their offense doesn't look as pretty.

It's like when the Nash supporters call him the best offensive player ever based on his teams offensive results, and insist they only lost because of their defense. Yeah, but you put more defense first guys around Nash, and suddenly he's not going to look quite as impactful on O, he's not going to have the spacing, and those offenses are going to fall off.",13,0.151,0.725,0.124,-0.4809,2.74

My observations:

1. Gobert has to help on PG, otherwise that's an easy lay up for PG. Donovan has to switch to the corner 3. He doesn't even make an effort to close out to T Mann. That's just poor effort from Donovan. He retreats out to Batum when he should have gone to the corner spot. That would have led to a pass to Batum, at which point Bojan has to rotate to Batum, which then would have led to a pass to Morris and Conley should rotate out to Morris. Finally, Morris would probably make the open pass to Reggie but at that point, O'Neale would have to rotate out to Reggie. By this time, there's probably 8-10 secs left on the clock and the ball wouldn't be moving as much. If you're the Jazz, this is 100% the better option as opposed to leaving Mann open at the corner 3 spot. Key thing here is rotation, rotation and rotation.
2. Again, Gobert comes to help. Nothing wrong with that. However, it's not on Gobert to close out to Mann. That's on Donovan again. You kind of have to split the difference between Mann and Batum, but the way Donovan is positioned, he's more concerned about Batum. Just look at all that space when Reggie makes the pass. Pay attention to when the ball bounces on the floor on the way to Mann's shooting pocket. Again, Donovan doesn't even try to close out to the corner shooter. Poor effort yet again. Gobert is in such a bad spot. If he closes out hard, he might foul Mann in the shooting motion.
3. Good defence by Gobert to start. I feel like Donovan should have taken another step closer to Batum and not be close to Reggie the moment Reggie passes to Batum. Batum is a smart player. He probably realized Donovan wouldn't contest the shot so he lets it fly. This is not on Gobert, this is on Donovan yet again. No effort for the third straight 3 pt shot with him being the closest defender each and every time.
4. Closest defender to Mann is Ingles, not Gobert. Ingles has to split the difference here, not be that close to Morris. Pause at the very moment Mann is just about to catch the ball and when he begins his shot wind up. Ingles is walking back. What kind of defence is this? How can you pin this on Gobert? Again, if he closes out too hard, he might foul Mann. This play is on Ingles. You have to split the difference here. By doing so, this allows O'Neale to swing to the wing spot to guard/contest Morris.
5. Same thing as 4. While Ingles did a better job at splitting the difference, he should have fully committed to contesting Mann's shot. O'Neale has to rotate out to Morris. Morris probably would have passed to PG up top at which point Conley would have to rotate out to PG. This would have left about 4-6 secs left on the clock. With Conley guarding PG, you take take any day (considering there would have been 4-6 secs left) over leaving a corner 3 shooter wide open.
6. Effort more so than anything. Clarkson has to close out faster than this. Either Clarkson fully commits to contesting the 3 by swinging right by him (not this half-assed close out) or he sprints fast enough and scares/stunts on Reggie and forces the Clippers to start the play all over again. Pause at the moment Reggie is in the shooting motion with the ball right over his head (right when the shot clock resets to 14). Look at how much space Reggie has. I don't even know what to say at this point. Everything I described so far leading up to point 6 comes down to two things: rotations and effort. Let's continue.
7. Hands up O'Neale, hands up!!! Pause at 4.9 secs left on the clock. Reggie is ready to let it fly. Ball in the shooting pocket and knees bent, all signs pointing to shooting the ball. Come on O'Neale. He has to assume that Reggie is gonna shoot. Chances are, Reggie is not gonna drive right and run in to Gobert. He's waiting to shoot. Put your hands up Royce!
8. Gobert is a split second late. He was in the paint for a split second longer than he needed to be. He's way too flat footed here. He has to properly contest this shot. Jump high and contest the shot man, come on.
9. Donovan completely lost track of the corner man. Donovan retreats out to Luke and forgets Pat Bev is in the corner. You HAVE to split the difference in these situations. If Donovan properly closes out to Pat Bev, he would have passed to Luke and Bojan would have to split the difference/rotate out to Luke. Once again, Donovan's lack of awareness is on full display.
10. I feel like for the most part, Gobert has good positioning to contest PG's shot but again, he has to jump higher and have his hands raised high. His right hand is tilted downwards when it should be pointed up high. The goal here is to disrupt PG's vision on the shot attempt. Better/stronger close out was needed. PG has way too much space to get the shot off.
11. Bojan is surveying his side of the court which is great. As soon as PG is about to make the pass, notice how his head is turned backwards/over his left shoulder towards Mann at the 17 sec mark. He probably thought Mann was going to drive/cut to the basket. Even if Mann attempts to drive/cut to the basket, Gobert is sitting in the paint. Bojan has to be two steps closer to Batum here. Gobert has to take ownership and communicate with Bojan by telling him to be closer to Batum, not Mann. 1. This right here is a lack of awareness by Bojan and Gobert.
12. Conley starts off by splitting the difference between Mann and Batum. This is what you want. Otherwise, Mann will be left completely open. You want to force Mann into making a decision - do I shoot or pass to my guy Batum? Conley gambles here by trying to steal the ball. You can only respect the effort here. However, when the pass goes out to Mann, Conley doesn't even make an attempt at closing out. He just gave up here. Complete lack of effort to end the defensive play. Why Conley? You did so well to start. You split the difference and attempted to steal the ball. Why did you just give up at the end?
13. Heat check shot by Pat Bev really. What more can you do here? For starters, get your hands up Bojan. You're daring Pat Bev to shoot, this is what you get.
14. Same thing as point 10. Gobert has to have his right hand up higher. Look at where his right hand is. It seems like his right hand palm is at eye-level. It has to be high above your head. You got a long reach, use it! Wtf you doing with this half-assed attempt at closing out? You want to disrupt Pat Bev's vision here.

Notice a trend here? Most of these plays, there was a defensive breakdown. Rotations were missed. Effort was missing. That's on the coach and the defensive anchor Rudy to tell his guys where they need to be. You see how Draymond is always yelling out to his guys where they need to be? Yea, that's more like it. What's one player that sticks out the most in all these plays above? Donovan Mitchell. He has poor awareness, vision and effort on the defensive side. Clippers were not only trying to exploit Gobert, they were trying to exploit Donovan too.

When I looked at those clips, I saw poor defence at the point of attack quite often. On plays 4 & 5, Reggie Jackson gets by Jordan Clarkson without a screen, forcing rotations to happen, and they weren't executed well. On another play, I believe play 2, Jackson backs Conley into the basket. I mean, that's just tough, in terms of defense at the point of attack. Not the fault of Gobert, to be sure.  Overall, I think that the primary reason for the poor rotations that we see in this clip is the injuries to Conley and Mitchell. They weren't able to move around as they usually would, and the reactive athleticism that is necessary to excel at guarding was clearly missing.  When you have two guards who are compromised, it's just gonna be tough to defend well. Sure, Clarkson, ONeale, Ingles, Bogdanovic, all those guys could have played better, but you have to think that they are cognizant of the fact that Mitchell and Conley are compromised, and their decision-making would have been influenced by it. In the end, they got beat in Game 6 by a 2nd half performance for the ages by Terrance Mann. They gave up open shots, yes, but they gave them up to a pretty unheralded guy. Given the circumstances, that's not too bad.",4,0.07,0.789,0.141,0.9403,2.91

Trading or selling low on Simmons just doesn't make any sense right now. I think KP also needs a **change of scenery,** but I will stand on the hill that KP will *probably* never live up to the expectations of his contract. His health, durability, and his size at 7'3, and declining DPBM along with his offensive weaknesses, (not being able to post up, size up smaller defenders, handling, inside post moves,) have been well documented in the playoffs. Not to mention the 76ers should be adverse at taking on **two bigs** with huge health concerns. It would be foolish to be trading your ONLY true asset with any positive **trade** value, as much as people try to suggest that Simmons is virtually 'worthless.' He was recently All-NBA, still voted All-Star, and was 2nd in DPOY this year... He was along with Embiid/Thybulle, their most valuable defender and a reason why they were ranked the top 5 ranked defense. I think the 76ers best course of action would be to find suitors that would take Harris on. Maybe see if the Raptors would like to move on from Pascal Siakam or Pistons with Jerami Grant. The Kings could also be an interesting trade partner with Buddy Hield.  I mean if the Wolves were interested in a Simmons deal centered around D'Angelo Russell & Malik Beasley, I could also see that happening too. What they need to do is basically surround Embiid and Simmons with more shooters. Tobias Harris is a solid 3rd option, but his shot profile consisted of a lot of mid range shots which killed the spacing. Also Doc Rivers deserve some criticism for the blame in the Atlanta Hawks series for constantly trotting out lineups that featured Thybulle, Simmons, and Howard together.",3,0.079,0.762,0.158,0.9772,4.08
"nbadiscussion","XenaRen","[Serious] Why doesn't a NBA team try to re-create a European All-Star team?","2021-28-06 7:27:39 PM","I had a YouTube suggestion today of the USA vs Spain 2012 Gold Medal game on YouTube. The US ended up winning 107-100 but this was a close game the whole way through. Tied going into halftime, tied going into the 4th. US had to have some clutch shots from Kobe to put the game away. Funny thing is - I'm old enough to remember this game and it wasn't even a surprise that the game was close. Spain was considered a force and while it would have been an upset - they had the ability to beat the US.

My question is why doesn't a NBA team - specifically a team that is already planning on tanking (OKC, maybe Orlando, etc) - commit to building an all European team? If this Spanish team could take a team of Kobe, Dwade, LeBron, KD, CP3, Harden, etc to the brink of elimination, clearly they could have succeeded in the NBA. I'll dive into this a little bit here but I would love to hear you alls comments as well.

To start, I want to discuss if it would be possible to build such a team - take the 2012 Spanish team for example. Marc and Pau Gasol would be the most expensive pieces from an asset acquisition standpoint quickly followed by Serge Ibaka. But after these three, the team is mostly convincing overseas players to come play in the NBA. This negotiation action costs nothing to a NBA team from an asset perspective because you're just signing them as FAs. In the off chance a team happens to own a players rights, a second rounder (possibly even protected) usually takes care of that.

Further - Juan Carlos Navarro (the teams third highest scorer) hadn't played in the NBA since '08, Rudy Fernandez was on the tail end of his NBA career, and Jose Calderon was a 10 ppg rotational player that could probably be acquired for a 2nd round pick. While the Gasols and Ibaka may have been slightly pricey, neither Gasol was near the top of their value from a trade perspective and I wouldn't consider any of these three even close to an ""untouchable"" such as a current day Luka, KD, Harden, etc. You could even time it where you're signing one or a couple of these guys as FAs and not giving up any assets.

I think building this team would have been possible for a 2012-2013 NBA team. If I told you I could give you a team that could give that star studded US team a run for their money - wouldn't you unload the warchest for that team? Also - big positive here - you can trade all your current assets so you may come out without having to unload too many future picks (aka teams about to enter a tank).

Next I want to discuss why(pros)/why not(cons) this team may work.

Pros: We all know European basketball is played and developed differently than the basketball in the US. There seems to be a higher interest in fundamentals and team play as opposed to IG highlights and AAU hero ball here in the US. Maybe this team could bring a ball movement and team approach that the NBA teams would have trouble stopping, ala the '14 Spurs. Maybe Euro players in the past have been thrown into the NBA's ""AAU environment"" and that environment contributed more to their downfall than their actual skillset. Maybe the overall talent level in Europe is higher than we expect and these players can hold their own with the best of the best when given a real opportunity. Even if the experiment doesn't work, you may not have given up many assets considering most players will just be signed via FA. You can just continue the tank and build through the draft.

Cons: It seems like you would have to go all in. To really give this experiment a shot - I don't think you can take that Spanish team and add a player like Rudy Gay and expect the skill sets to match. You'd probably have to bring in an international coaching staff too. Maybe it's a simple answer why this hasn't happened yet. There's a reason the majority of these guys aren't on NBA rosters and the average athleticism of the NBA is too overpowering and the team flops.

I was thinking about this further when considering this years Olympics. While I think the US will win - I think Spain could give them a challenge. This years Spanish team could be easily assembled as well, probably without even having to give any kind of first round pick. The US is only -360 to win the entire tourney with some of the top stars the NBA has to offer, which just seems low for a team with Lillard, Booker, Beal, KD, Bam, Tatum, etc. If this was an actual NBA team I feel like they'd be -1000 at least to win the whole Finals.

I'd love to hear you alls thoughts on this. Would you give this experiment a chance? Could that 2012 Spanish team won a NBA title? Would you be angry if your team tried something like this?","t3_o9z2ls","https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/o9z2ls/serious_why_doesnt_a_nba_team_try_to_recreate_a/",0,24,"t1_h3g5loh","2021-29-06 8:26:02 AM","Because the European All Star team isn't cheap? Marc Gasol was an all star in 2012... you think a team could just trade peanuts for him? Pau was aging but was still good for 17/10, Lakers aren't gonna trade him for nothing. Ibaka just led the league in blocks in 2012 and was a promising young big..... this is the guy PKC prioritized over Harden at the time. It ain't gonna be cheap to get these guys without literally gutting your team and trading a ton of assets. If you're a tanking team like the Kings, what could the Lakers/Thunder/Grizzlies possibly want from you? If you're a team like the Lakers/Thunder... would you trade a guy like Kobe/Durant to make a gimmick Euro team?  Then you have guys like Rudy Fernandez who simply don't want to play in the NBA, and you'd have to overpay him to get him here... there is a reason why the 2012 Spain team was good, it's because they had all star caliber NBA players lol. The reason why the betting line is like that is because FIBA/Olympics is single elimination where you could easily lose despite being the better team. For instance, Argentina was able to win gold in 2004, does that mean they could win the NBA championship in 2005 if you ported the team over? Hell no.",2,0.082,0.722,0.196,0.986,3.46

In my opinion for the number one overall pick to be considered, a success they must make at least multiple all-star appearances. And on the verge of making the hall of fame as a 1st ballot.  But this can be seen as a bit too much since players can be successful in the league without doing so. But I believe this is a good indicator of whether the player lived up to their potential. Now Looking back at the last 10 years of number 1 picks, I determined if they meet my criteria.

"nbadiscussion","addictivesign","What are the futures of the Big 4 big market squads?","2021-24-06 8:58:42 AM","Smaller markets are building nice futures right now. For example, Atlanta has a nice young core captained by Trae Young that will be good for years in the East. Milwaukee has a good competitive future as long as Giannis is around. Phoenix and Denver have great futures out West. Teams like Memphis, Minnesota, and OKC could have really bright futures. 

The big 4 teams (Nets, Lakers, Clippers, Knicks) are the four that get most of the national media headlines. The Nets, Lakers, and Clippers are present-built contenders that are built around superstars but have pretty cloudy long term futures. The Knicks have a younger squad, but made a good impression and improvement this season which could make them a primary place for free agents. 

These are the teams that get the most buzz, yet aren’t really built for years to come. What do you think is the future of Lakers, in a world where LeBron is inching closer to retirement and AD gets older? What is the future of the Clippers, as Kawhi and PG age? What is the future of the Nets, as the big 3 come up for contracts in the next few years? Are the Knicks building something good or is it a mirage?

Will any of these teams have a future of mediocrity again? Will they continue to thrive? What do you see for the future of these teams that aren’t really built for it compared to others?","t3_o73sue","https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/o73sue/what_are_the_futures_of_the_big_4_big_market/",3,3,"t1_h2wudis","2021-24-06 11:14:07 AM","I think the Knicks are a mirage. They will improve and of course they’ll be far better than what they’ve been for most of the last decade but if you assess their roster they have a distinct lack of top tier talent and now they’re too good to suck or tank and get top quality talent through the draft. Look at Kevin Knox and Frank N, those draft selections could be other players who could be transformational for the Knicks. As the established team in the biggest market they should become a free agent destination but the biggest problem the Knicks (and other teams face) is less and less players move via free agency. Most of the high profile players have recently re-upped with their current teams. Now when superstars want to move they just demand a trade, it’s messy but they get what they want largely because agents and franchises are so interconnected to the detriment of the sport.  The Knicks could go all in on a trade and give up all their picks and swaps for a player like e.g Beal but then you’re giving up all your future assets. No different than what the Nets and Bucks have just done for Harden and Jrue respectively. I think the wildcard for the Knicks is Zion. If it’s true he wants out as early as possible from N’awlins then perhaps he’ll land in NYC in the near term. I can honestly see him accepting his Q/O and turning down a $200 million rookie extension contract so he can sign as a free agent in NYC because he would become King of the city and his endorsements would probably come to a quarter billion in less than a decade.  But if Zion merely wants a bigger market then I can see Atlanta trading a lot of stuff to pair Trae and Zion together. It’s known that Zion wanted the Hawks to win the lottery that year. The fact that the Hawks are in the ECF means they would definitely be a team Zion would want to play for now. I think if the Big 3 extend with the Nets then Durant, Kyrie and Harden will bring multiple championships to Brooklyn and the Nets dominate the NBA and become a heavyweight franchise forever. The Knicks were asleep at the wheel for too long.  No-one can persuade me if Harden’s hamstring was 100% and Giannis didn’t get in the way of Kyrie landing on his ankle that anyone had a chance of beating them. It would have been amazing basketball to watch. Now we have to wait until next season. Lakers are in a tight spot with their cap and will have to be so judicious this off-season. Given they have LeBron and AD they should always be considered a serious contender and they’ll attract other top players, vets and ring chasers but they are boxed in and don’t have easy options and owe draft picks. Clippers owe draft picks too but how bad is Kawhi’s injury? He’s been so banged up since his final year in San Antonio but at the same time when he plays in the best two way player in the league. I fear PG is just too inconsistent for a championship run. He runs hot, sometimes scorching hot and then cold and ineffective. At least they have an owner who will spend!",3,0.062,0.768,0.17,0.9968,5.2

Because of this, instead of the CP3-Ayton connection that we all tuned in to watch, we got CP3-Frank the Tank. It’s the finals, and we are not seeing the best basketball possible because of a seemingly arbitrary foul limit. 


I don’t think it’s good for the game to have the best players sitting on the bench for large stretches of the game in what is essentially a “time out” for bad behavior. Imagine if Chris Godwin had to sit out of the 3rd quarter of the Super Bowl because he had been called for holding too much in the first half. 

Also, so many calls in the NBA are judgement calls and if a few iffy whistles come your way, it could change your entire game plan by removing one of your best players. It becomes a huge issue in OT and 2OT games when the game is literally longer than normal but the foul limit stays at 6. Every time I see a 2OT game it seems like people are fouling out left and right. 

What is the point of the foul limit? If the goal is to discourage “dirty” play, is the limit too low?

I think at the very least, the limit should be raised to 8. Deandre Ayton was not playing dirty last night. He wasn’t being a menace, and he didn’t deserve to be removed from the game for such a long stretch.

That way a guy may have to sit some for a half but it doesn't totally screw the game.  I realize fouls are sometimes bad plays and sometimes part of a strategy.    I also don't really mind the 3 shots to make 2 free throws (or 4 shots to make 3) when fouled by someone who has a lot of fouls.  Maybe that would be something to consider - give a set foul limit per half ( such as 3 or 4) and have those reset at the half to zero. So you get a fresh slate the second half.  But mix in that once a player gets 6 fouls total (first and second half total) the player fouled gets an extra shot at his free throw attempts.  Then once the limit of fouls per half are reached the player fouls out.

Here are what I consider the top 10 playoff games in his career. I'm taking into account the production (statistics and performance), the importance (elimination game, closeout game) the stage ( Finals, WCF, WCSF) and the context. Although Kobe doesn't have as many iconic epic playoff performances like Jordan, Lebron, Magic etc, he still came through when it mattered most.

10. 2009 WCSF Game 4 vs Utah Jazz. 38 points, 1 assist, 6 rebounds, 16/24 FG. Coming off one of his worst playoff games shooting an anemic 5/24 in game 3, Kobe responded in Game 4 with a barrage of tough midrange jumpers claiming a commanding 3-1 lead.

9. 2009 Finals, Game 1 vs Orlando Magic. 40 points, 8 assists, 8 rebounds. 16/34 FG. Coming into this finals, people still doubted whether Kobe could lead his team to a championship without Shaq. So Kobe put up his one and only 40 point final game.

8. 2008 WCSF, Game 5 vs San Antonio Spurs. 39 points, 3 assists, 3 rebounds, 16/30 FG. One of his most underrated series, Kobe had to face a prime defending champion San Antonio Spurs. He closed the Spurs out in game 5 with this performance which included 17 in the 4th.

7. 2001 WCSF, Game 4 vs Sacramento Kings. 48 points, 3 assists, 16 rebounds, 15/29 FG, 17/19 FT. 22 year old Kobe put the Kings away with an epic performance including 15 points in the 4th when they came into the 4th down 4.

6. 2002 Finals, Game 3 vs New Jersey. 36 points, 4 assists, 6 rebounds, 14/23 FG. Lakers came into game 3 up 2-0, winning game 3 meant winning the series. Kobe had his best game of the finals and hit a clutch dagger jump shot to put the Lakers up 4 with 20 seconds remaining sealing the finals victory.

5. 2008 WCFR, Game 2 vs Denver Nuggets. 49 points, 10 assists, 4 rebounds, 18/27 FG. In terms of pure production this is no doubt Kobe's most dominant playoff game.

4. 2010 WCF, Game 6 vs Phoenix Suns. 37 points, 2 assists, 6 rebounds, 12/25 FG. Game 6 closeout game for the Lakers. Kobe scored 11 in the 4th including 2 incredibly tough fadeaway jumpers in the face of Grant Hill in the final minute with the iconic slap on coach Alvin Gentry's butt, securing their spot in the finals.

3. 2006 WCFR, Game 6 vs Phoenix Suns. 50 points, 5 assists, 8 rebounds, 20/35 FG. Easily would be his greatest playoff performance had they won but unfortunately they lost through no fault of Kobe's. He put up a Herculean performance but the undertalented Lakers lost.

2. 2004 WCSF, Game 4 vs San Antonio Spurs. 42 points, 5 assists, 6 rebounds, 15/27 FG. Heading into Game 3, the Lakers were down 2-0 vs the spurs. After winning Game 3, the Lakers NEEDED to win Game 4 as going down 3-1 most likely would spell doom for the Lakers. Kobe put up 42 points, the momentum shifted the entire series and the Lakers would win the next 2 and beat the Spurs.

&#x200B;

1. 2000 Finals, Game 4 vs Indiana Pacers. 28 points, 5 assists, 4 rebounds, 14/27 FG. I bet most people are wondering why this fairly mediocre performance is what I consider his greatest playoff performance. This is because of the context behind this game. Lakers came into this game up 2-1 in a pivotal Game 4, meaning if the Lakers won this game, they most likely would win the series. The game went into overtime in which Shaq had fouled out whilst the game was still tight. Kobe proceeded to score 8 points in the final 2 minutes including a putback dagger with 5 seconds remaining that iced the game, sealing the win. Considering the importance of this game and the stage along with the fact that he was only 20 years old, I believe this to be his best playoff game.","t3_ofimpa","https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/ofimpa/kobe_bryant_top_10_playoff_games/",15,11,"t1_h4cncgd","2021-07-07 6:23:41 AM","[removed]",-1,0,1,0,0,1.5

Rim protection is still massively important on defense, rebounding still matters, pick and roll benefits from a dominant big, a passing big can open up a lot on offense, and you’ll always need someone who can defend the dominant bigs in the league. The role of bigs has changed to require more skill and versatility, but if you find one that can fill that role it’s extremely valuable.  That said, in today’s game, if the players are equally talented, give me the guard. Perimeter is more important in this current style of play.",2,0.02,0.762,0.218,0.9704,3.68

Offense vs Defense","2021-08-07 6:57:14 AM","This [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/ofqosc/is_the_nba_making_a_mistake_marketing_players/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) got me thinking... Would anyone watch basketball played NFL style, with Defensive / Offensive teams?

  
Kinda like half court playground games. take a free throw to determine who gets first possession. No winners or losers out. Each team gets 3 minutes to score however much they can. Team A's offensive 5 versus Team B's defensive 5. Then give the ball to the other team, their turn. Take a break after 12 minutes. 

Keep taking turns, keep adding the scores, similar to how they do it currently for the All Star Game, for each quarter scores. It might lead to impossibly large margins, like this year's All Star, but that's where the defense would really have to put their stamp on the game, to ensure the scores don't become too much for their offensive team to overcome. 

Would this allow specialists or extreme GOATs to really shine? Like, how much would Steph and co. be able to pour in the 3s on a quintet focused only on stopping him? Or, how much would a team of Ben Simmons type players cause havoc on an offense? Or would a really good Offensive / Defensive Coach be able to finally show his true value?

Players wouldn't get played off the court as they could simply focus on their primary strengths - offense or defense. We have situational subs now anyway, but in this case we'd have a longer time to be in that situation.

"nbadiscussion","Desmondo110","A comparison of FTA per 36 in the Regular Season vs. Post Season 2015 - 2021","2021-01-07 9:22:03 AM","The NBA announced that it would be changing the rules to help curb some of the unnatural motion that players use to game the rules and draw fouls.  The announcement specifically called out Trae Young and James Harden, but this could also be applied to many other foul baiters, like Joel Embiid, Chris Paul, and Kevin Durant.  During the post season, it is not uncommon to see these master baiters complain to the refs after not getting a call that they may have gotten dozens of times in the regular season or earlier rounds of the playoffs.  Are these players actually getting fewer fouls called for them in the post season compared to the regular season?

I wanted to determine if the players are actually getting fewer fouls in the post season.  Using Basketball Reference player statistics for the regular season and post season dating back to 2015, I tried to accomplish just that.  To take out any bias that might be created by small sample sizes, I removed any player-season, where the player played fewer than 500 regular season minutes and fewer than 80 post season minutes.  I then calculated the number of FTA per 36 minutes in the regular season and the post season for each player-year.  I then created a scatter plot with the X-axis as regular season FTA per 36 and Y-axis of post season FTA per 36.  If players were getting fouled at the same rate in the regular season as the post season, a linear regression would have a slope of 1, so I added this ideal line to the chart in black.  I also added the actual linear regression line to the chart, which can be seen below in blue:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/mt7s5l2efm871.png?width=561&format=png&auto=webp&s=830325af553aa1fa5bf2b8ec534417fff4474301

The linear regression model has slope of 0.91 and an intercept of 0.23, which indicates that a theoretical player who draws zero fouls per 36 in the regular season would draw .23 fouls per 36 in the post season.  On the flip side, a player that leads the league in fouls drawn in the regular season would have the biggest drop in FTA in the playoffs.  This can be seen by how the blue linear regression line clearly starts to deviate away from the ideal line at around 5 FTA per 36.  It appears as if players that draw few fouls in the regular season are being rewarded with additional FTA in the post season and players that drew more fouls in the regular season are being punished with fewer FTA in the playoffs.  

This effect is likely the result of a combination of factors: defenders learning more of the offensive players foul baiting tricks over the course of a 7 game series and refs changing how they ref in the post season, and ""letting the players play.""  It begs to the question if refs should ref the same way in the regular season and post season?

Some fun statistical nuggets from this analysis:

* In 2017 Dewayne Dedmon shot nearly 12 FTs per 36 in the playoffs after shooting 2.5 in the regular season.  He made just over half of them.
* In 2020 Joel Embiid shot the highest number of FTs per 36 in the last 6 seasons, 14.6 because the Boston Celtics tried to defend him Daniel Theis and Enes Kanter.  The Celtics still swept the series.
* Of the top 10 highest FTA per 36 in the regular season, Giannis in 2021 has the worst ratio of post season to regular season free throw attempts.  10.4 FTA/36 in the regular season compared to 7.8 FTA/36 in the post season.","t3_obpavr","https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/obpavr/a_comparison_of_fta_per_36_in_the_regular_season/",16,6,"t1_h3pcyex","2021-01-07 10:20:06 AM","This was super interesting.

IMO baseball could use AI for balls and strikes, and probably fouls as well.  That is just identifying where the ball is in relation to the plate/field.  Track the ball with lasers or video, and correlate the location.  I think the ball/strike detectors shown during games work pretty well.   I wish football would use a laser to determine if it's a first down or not.  I can't stand that they drag the chains out, everyone stands around for minutes.  Have the ref place a marker at the ball, another shine a laser at right angles from the first down marker, simple yes/no.   However for basketball, there are way too many factors involved that an AI would need to evaluate.  All the players, their distance from other players, are they touching anywhere, who initiated contact, did he shuffle his feet, did he get all ball or hit the hand, did he carry the ball, who hit it last, was that a kick?   We are not even close to having that type of technology, not to mention programming ability.   Possible the people that are automating autonomous fighter/bombers could do it eventually - at great cost - but that is in it's infancy and not yet in use.  People are working on automated cars, that is the level of technology we're talking about, and that is still in test phase.   None of it would be cheap.   Also there's no such thing as *sensors*.

Not much else to add but need to fill the word count. The facts that CP3 made both all NBA and all star over devin booker (only made all star as an injury replacement) baffled me all season. 

Obviously I'm not denying the positive impacts CP3 has had on the suns, but when people start putting him in the MVP convo is where I draw the line. Don't think anybody will argue 16-5-9 regular season stats are MVP numbers. Booker was better than CP3 all season, and now Booker and Ayton are both better than CP3 in the playoffs.

CP3 was injured and played like trash in the first round against LAL and the suns were fine without him. In the current series against the LAC, PHX again won 2 games without him.

When people say ""last year PHX was 10th and this year they're 2nd and in the WCF with him"" I feel is a very misleading statement. It would be like saying last year ATL was 14th and this year theyre 5th and in the ECF, therefore Bogdanovic is the MVP.

For anyone who doesn't know what RAPM is, it basically looks at a player's plus-minus every single possession of every single game over the time frame, and then adjusts it based on who his teammates were on the floor and who the defenders were on the floor, and adds it all up in some complex statistical analysis to estimate a player's impact. **There's no box score stats whatsoever when calculating RAPM.**

Long-term multiyear RAPM is considered the gold standard of NBA advanced stats and all modern advanced stats are built upon it. Since it's an objective calculation using solely plus-minus on a possession by possession basis with no box score stats whatsoever, it's considered the least biased way to evaluate a player's impact. Of course, no stat is without its faults, and even this 10 year time frame can underrate players who were developing in the beginning (like Dirk, Chris Paul, Lebron) or aging at the end (Tim Duncan, Ray Allen). Also just to note that this is only regular season over this time frame. 

Here's the source: https://sites.google.com/site/rapmstats/10-year-rapm. I only wanted to look at offense for this post. 

Tied 1st: Kobe Bryant/Lebron James, 

2nd: Dwayne Wade, 

3rd: Steve Nash, 

4th: Chris Paul, 

5th: Manu Ginobli, 

6th: Baron Davis, 

7th: Antawn Jamison, 

8th: Jason Kidd, 

Tied 9th: Dirk Nowitzki/Ray Allen, 

10th: Chauncey Billups

Anything interesting from these rankings? Anything that pops out? I think pertaining to Kobe Bryant the results are interesting as often in the current day there seems to be some people who portray Kobe Bryant as an inefficient scorer compared to other all-time greats when in reality his offensive impact was unparalleled during his time. His shot creation ability on very high volume on good efficiency along with his playmaking was clearly extremely efficient offense. Seeing Baron Davis here is also a big surprise. Ginobli is also somewhat surprising but most people who watched him play can attest to just how potent his offense was. He was James Harden before James Harden. 

Seeing guys like Antawn Jamison, Baron Davis, Jason Kidd ranked above Dirk (I must add that they're very slightly above him) is a headscratcher, but when you look at a 6 year RAPM from 2006 to 2011, Dirk's offense is ranked 3rd, so clearly Dirk had improved a ton from 2002 to 2006.  

Something that I thought was interesting to note was that Antawn Jamison was a TERRIBLE defender despite the elite offense. Despite being 7th in offensive RAPM, his total RAPM was ranked in 52 because of his terrible defense. 

And of course Lebron James tied at 1st also is interesting but not too surprising.

* physicality/durability he's Slim Reaper thin, but is still really young
* needs to prove he can stretch the floor as a modern 4, was asked to play more traditionally at USC (only 40 3pt attempts)
* has to balance being a team player with being assertive, doesn't 'take over', plays his game and takes his shots but doesn't force

Giannis does have some limitations but it takes either an elite big man defender with strength and quickness to guard him, or you need to form a wall with multiple defenders. You have to gameplan your entire defense around him. He may not be suited as the “closer” but he’s been dominant these playoffs, he can absolutely be the primary scorer. The adjustment I think his game needs is to move him off ball more and utilize him as a screener/cutter more often, and also improve his midrange game to prevent teams from just forming a wall. Of course that would require having more playmakers on the team, which they don’t have.  Khris isn’t consistent enough to be a #1, he’s better suited as a secondary scorer and closer.  I agree on Jrue, his best seasons have been when he’s had another guard to share playmaking responsibilities with, he’s more of a secondary playmaker than a primary.  I do think they could use a better coach but that’s a lot easier said than done; Bud’s not elite but he’s absolutely a good coach.",2,0.009,0.784,0.207,0.9909,3.57

The 5 Biggest Stock Risers During These NBA Playoffs

The NBA is interesting because during the regular season, fans and media members overreact to players’ performances and form their “player rankings”, only for the playoffs to come around and completely dismantle the aforementioned ranking system. I say this to make the point that when we TRULY think about who the best players in the world are, we need to more heavily consider what they do in May, June and July as opposed to what they do when half of the teams are load managing. For example, take a guy like Julius Randle. He made 3rd team all-NBA (as he should have) because he had a remarkable regular season, leading a Knicks team that played their hearts out in all 72 of their games and earned a 4 seed in the competitive Eastern Conference. However, when the playoff came around and the intensity was heightened, Randle didn’t look like himself. He couldn’t overpower people in the paint anymore, he didn’t create as much space to shoot his mid-range, and he didn’t shoot the ball well from anywhere on the court. Randle is a great player, but he’s not a top 15 NBA player yet - not even close - and it’s because of what he’s done (or hasn’t done) in the most important games that an NBA player can play. Playoff games. 

Note: When ranking the biggest playoff stock risers, I’m considering two main components: 

1) How much better the player performs in the playoffs as opposed to the regular season and 

2) How much more recognition a player gets during the playoffs as opposed to during the regular season (most often a result of a certain team not playing many nationally televised games or not playing in a big market, among other reasons).

5) Kevin Huerter

Kevin Huerter’s rise is definitely a testament in part to the 2nd ranking criteria; he plays in a small market (ATL) and is an unassuming, young player who was drafted in the same draft as Trae Young (and therefore has been overshadowed in the early part of his career). However, this man can flat out BALL, and it’s been a pleasure to watch him flourish in these playoffs. First of all, he’s 6 foot 7 and a good athlete. Yes, a good athlete. He gets super high on his jump shot, and it allows him to EASILY get shots up on shorter players, both out of the post and in the pick and roll; if you didn’t get a chance to watch ATL-PHI game 7, check out Huerter’s highlights from that game in which he absolutely exposes the Sixers (specifically Seth Curry) in the mid-range. He doesn’t just have the pull-up in his bag, though, he also has an underrated handle which allows him to get to multiple different spots on the court. We’ve seen him defended by some of the best defenders in the league during these playoffs (Jrue Holiday and Ben Simmons) and still be able to handle the rock under pressure and physicality. The ability to get to spots in the mid range and rise up to hit shots consistently is something that’s sustainable to build an offensive game around (we’ve seen guys like Beal, Booker, Durant, Middleton, and MANY OTHERS do it already), and Huerter is in an excellent position to do it as well, especially considering he’s only 22 years old. Huerter has also shown a solid ability to make plays for others. He has a high level understanding of offense and is always decisive and confident in his moves and passes, allowing him to be a secondary playmaker for the Hawks during this postseason. If you diligently watched the Hawks this postseason, you’ve probably seen a few of his cross court, lefty passes off the dribble. That’s high level stuff. Finally, Huerter plays on BOTH ENDS of the court! He’s shown some incredible fight while having to defend the likes of Tobias Harris, Ben Simmons, Jrue Holiday, Khris Middleton, and many other talented offensive players. He’s just a really good athlete with long arms who plays his butt off on that end and isn’t afraid to be physical and put his body on the line.  

4) Cameron Payne 

Cam Payne’s first claim to fame in the NBA was for his pregame dance routines with Russell Westbrook. Also, he was literally playing in China 2 years ago, and on multiple D-League teams before that, so it’s safe to say he definitely wasn’t on the average NBA fan’s radar prior to this postseason. He’s had an unbelievable turnaround, though, and he is about to get absolutely paid when he becomes a free agent next season. Payne has this special bounce in his step that I haven’t really seen before; he looks like he could be shot out of a cannon at any point and glide his way to the hoop. He’s also got a really nice floater game around the basket, and he can finish athletically with both hands and with control of his body at the rim. He pairs this with fantastic vision and a 6 foot 7 (!) wingspan, which makes him an unbelievable offensive threat. Before game 6 of the WCF (where CP3 assured all doubters that he is indeed the point God), there was a very persuasive case to be made that Cam Payne had been more effective than Chris Paul against LAC. This is because when CP3 was out of the lineup due to Covid, Payne took his game to a whole new level. We saw a confidence and comfortability that we hadn’t seen before with him, probably because he finally got the start and played big, important minutes. I had thought that maybe he would lose that bounce in his step over the course of a 48 minutes game if he was tasked with playing starting point guard minutes. Perhaps, I had thought, he was only that energetic because he comes in for 6 minute bursts. Well, I was dead wrong. Payne was as spry as he’s looked throughout these entire playoffs in games 1 and 2 of the WCF against LAC, and it has most definitely earned him a starting point guard spot in his near future, whether it be with Phoenix or another team. He’s going to get offered big money from an organization in free agency, much like Terry Rozier was offered a massive contract by the Hornets after his huge playoff performance with the Celtics in their 2018 playoff run to the conference finals. Payne has proven himself to be an impact player who deserves a firm spot in an NBA starting lineup, as well as a much larger contract than his current one (2 years, $2.1mil). The days of Cam Payne being “the guy who dances” are over, and he’s here to stay. He’ll be dancing ON the court from now on... 

3) Dillon Brooks

I must admit that I’m definitely considering the play-in games in conjunction with the playoff games when ranking these players, whether that’s logical or not. But guess what? I’m writing the article, so there’s unfortunately nothing you can do about it, unless you’d like to leave me a nasty comment at the bottom of this article. If Brooks and the Grizzlies had somehow found a way to surpass the Jazz, and Brooks had continued playing the way he was, there’s a very real possibility that Brooks would have been number one on this list. The Dillon Brooks that we saw in both the play-ins and the play-offs is a two way STUD that we didn’t have the pleasure of witnessing during the regular season nearly enough due to him playing in Memphis and therefore being overshadowed by both Ja and Jonas, not to mention playing in a small market. He’s got one of the better motors I’ve seen in the NBA, and it allows him to be a pest on defense like not many others can. He guards the best player on the other team in virtually every game MEM plays, and he WANTS IT, too. He loves the competition, he loves getting in your grill and making you miserable for 94 feet, and he loves being physical. In other words, his game (specifically on the defensive end) is tailor-made to the playoffs. On the offensive end, Brooks showed unbelievable strides in his skillset during the playoffs. He’s 6 foot 7 and 225 pounds, and he’s got a surprisingly polished offensive game. Like Huerter, he has a solid handle and can get to his spots in the mid-range and just rise up, which allows him to shoot over defenders with ease. He’s a lot stronger going to the hoop than Huerter, though, and he’s got a real knack for finishing around the rim with a number of different push-type shots with both hands. Finally, he can hit the three point shot, which forces defenses to guard him on the perimeter, therefore opening up room for Brooks to attack the paint. If Brooks continues his development on the offensive end, I really think he can turn into one of the best two-way players in the NBA. He averaged 25.8 points in this postseason against a very solid Jazz defense, and there’s no question he’s already one of the toughest perimeter defenders to go up against in the league. He’s only going to continue to improve, and he’s a name that you’re going to hear in the all-star conversation next year.

2) Trae Young

If you had any gripe with Trae Young being considered a superstar before the playoffs, you can no longer have that gripe. I mean, you can, you would just be very wrong. Trae Young has a few offensive qualities that, when paired together, make him virtually impossible to stop. The first thing he has is a great shooting touch from range; you can’t leave him with a step, or else he’ll get his three off quickly and will kill you. This forces defenses to pick him up basically as soon as he walks over halfcourt (much like Curry or Lillard), and it forces them to go over screens as well. The second thing that Trae possesses is an unbelievable first step - probably the best in basketball. His change of speed and ability to burst by the defense is second to none in the NBA, and when paired with his ability to shoot, it allows him to drive with incredible ease; he had the 3rd most drives per game in the entire NBA this season, which is pretty remarkable for a scrawny guy like Trae. Trae also has the best floater game in the NBA (by far). He takes and makes the most floaters in the league, and he doesn’t really need any space or time to get it off, which makes it quite lethal. He’s also the best lob thrower in the NBA; his lob (the majority of the time to either Capela or Collins) looks exactly like his floater, too, so it makes the Hawks virtually impossible to defend once Trae gets in the painted area. When Trae throws the ball in the air, the defense is afraid to block it (because if it’s a floater, it could be called for goaltending), and that oftentimes results in an easy dunk for one of the athletic ATL front court players. When combining these three qualities (shooting touch, quick first step, and lethal floater/lob game), it makes Trae dominant offensively. It doesn’t end there, though. Trae has that killer instinct, which I think many people were surprised by; people thought that once the pressure intensified as it does during the playoffs, Trae would have a hard time dealing with it. Instead, however, Trae used the defenses’ over-aggression to his advantage, blowing by the defense and either getting fouled or getting to his floater/lob game. He talked trash to opposing players, opposing fans, and literally anyone who was willing to listen to him. Against PHI, not only did he play against one of the meanest fanbases in the league, but he was defended primarily by Ben Simmons and Matisse Thybulle, two incredibly tough and physical PLAYOFF defenders. He wasn’t phased in the slightest, and it was unbelievably fun to watch. Trae put the entire ATL team on his back throughout the entire playoffs, and he’s proven that he must be considered a top 5 NBA point guard.

I'm not going to pretend like I have some unique things to say, but I do have some thoughts, and hopefully other's have more insightful things to say.  

First, the Suns' guard tandem really shows the value of the midrange, even in this age of efficiency.  When defenses get tougher in the playoffs/finals, and when there is more time to game plan and prepare, the easy buckets and threes often get taken away, and having one, or even two players who can use screens, get mismatches, or even iso up and get to spots in the midrange and score is invaluable.  

Second, Giannis looked healthy, but completely disappeared for most of the game after a strong first quarter.  Suddenly, with 4 minutes left and the game pretty much out of reach, he became super active and energetic.  Very disappointing game for him, and for the Bucks, who just seem to be much more a great regular season team/average playoff team.  Giannis' game just is too limited it seems, he's got no versatility, and really looked like he didn't want to go the line.  Bud is at fault here too.  Giannis, not coincidently, was active (if not good, maybe) when Bud finally went to him as a center and played a small ball line up.  It was too little, too late, but we'll see it again if Bud is smart, so maybe we'll see it.  

Third, CP3 and Booker were really hunting mismatches on big men and feasting on them.  Bud either needs to change his defensive scheme, or play more Giannis at the 5, but that really seems like something Giannis can only do in spurts.  Paul was amazing in these matchups and really looked in full control of the game from the second quarter on.  We may see the worst contract in sports win the Finals MVP.","t3_ofjltq","https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/ofjltq/thoughts_on_game_1_2021_finals/",54,25,"t1_h4dg30x","2021-07-07 10:03:09 AM","Bucks are going to blow this one because Bud can't make adjustments in game to save his life. It was laughable how easily PHX was getting whatever they wanted in the 3rd and him just letting the lead balloon like that. Middleton getting hot from beyond the arc kept them in it, but that's no recipe for success long term in this series. Giannis looking less than 100% is also giving them very little to work with. They are going to get absolutely crushed by the CP3/Booker tandem just forcing those switches and making them pay all series long.  And we already know that the Bucks are damn near incapable of doing the same thing based on this postseason. The Bucks being a really dumb team is going to come to full fruition here; there's no way that Chris Paul is letting this opportunity slip away if he's healthy enough to play throughout this series. Both he and Booker are way too good as playmakers to swarm them, the Suns have great perimeter shooting throughout, and Ayton is always available for easy finishes and cuts to the rim once the defense collapses.  If Giannis gets healthier then they could push it to 6, but I think it's more realistically Phoenix in 5.",10,0.112,0.73,0.159,0.9031,3.09

Also think the potential for a Rashard Lewis/Ray combo could have been a great fit for today’s offensive philosophies. I think Ray’s physical abilities could have been harnessed to support the shooting. Would love to see what his career would have been had an offense had been built around him at the beginning of his career rather than the not as efficient Glenn Robinson. Obviously Ray had a great career but think he could’ve possibly ushered in this era a tad earlier w the right coach. 

Steve Nash
Amazing shooting splits. Similar court vision and  skills. I think even Nash himself has mentioned that he would have been developed differently today. He shot solidly in the 40% from deep throughout his career but never took more than five attempts. A real tragedy. 

Mark Price
Maybe not quite on the level as the other two but Price was awesome. Unfortunately both him and his squad had some devastating injuries. I think Price is an interesting candidate because he put up 40% and had an incredible AST/TO ratio. From a stats perspective these two metrics hold the most weight in predicting winning basketball games. Would be interested to see how this translated over a larger user rate. It’s also worth noting that Price played on some Cavs teams with notoriously slow pace of play.

Who is a more valuable/better player, KAT or DeAndre Ayton?

I give the nod to KAT because he is the best stretch 5/shooting big of all time and that skillset and ability to space the floor at the 5 is incredibly valuable. His criticisms are his poor defense, but his shooting is elite and his rebounding is pretty good.

Ayton has gotten praise for his great defense in the playoffs, but every opponent his team has faced in the playoffs has had major injuries to their team. Davis was injured after during game 4, prior to that he had 2 b2b 34 point games. Jokic and the Nuggets were down 2 starters and had to entirely carry the offensive load, which no doubt had a serious effect on his passing due to the lack of scoring threats, making it easier to put him on an island or just force his role players to hit shots. And the Clippers now have two injured centers who are DNP and despite having no true 5 to guard anymore, Ayton had his worse game of the series and possibly the playoffs vs Boogie and Batum. 

I just think that KATs skillset is more rare and valuable and allows the team to do a lot more than a traditional, yet very good big in Ayton. KAT has also had completely garbage teams around him for most of his career, minus one or two years, and poor coaching except for this last year. 

Ayton’s skillset is a lot more replaceable imo too, and I fail to see him becoming as dominant as the highest echelon of bigs in the game such as Davis, Jokic and Embiid just based on the eye test.

&#x200B;

Gilbert Arenas in his prime was one of the most disgusting basketball players of all time (in a good way).

However his prime was one of the shortest basketball primes in history, really only lasting for 3 seasons from 04-05 to 06-07.

In 07 he averaged 28PPG along with 6APG and nearly 2 steals, he was one of the best offensive players in the league along with above average defense at just 25 years old.

After 07 he would play just 15 games in the next 2 seasons after tearing apparently everything in his knee. (I tried looking what he tore in his knee and i got about 14 different answers so im just going to say it was an ACL tear)

After the injuries Gilbert was never the same, as his athleticism was completely sapped away from the ACL tear, he had a good season in 2010 but it was cut short after just 32 games played.

Gilbert Arenas would retire from the NBA at 30 years old.

So the question is, how would Gilbert be without injuries, Probably pretty good.

Without injuries i could see gilbert improving a good amount and having his prime be from 04-12 and possibly even play until anywhere from 2015 to 2018.

i think after 2012 arenas's passing skills would be a lot more appreciated as due to wear & tear from his play style i feel would turn more into a traditional point guards and his assist numbers would go up from 5-7 a game to more like 8-10 a game, while his scoring goes down from high 20's low 30's down to low 20's high 10's.

I think gilberts numbers for his career would be around:

For instance, there is a huge group of people that defend players like Westbrook, Giannis and Gobert despite the fact that they have come up short of expectations in the playoffs. Coaches such as Dwane Casey and Budenholzer were both very successful regular season coaches that came up short of expectations in the playoffs and have received almost unanimous disapproval because of their post season struggles. We can't forget that Bud was the coach of the year in 2015 and 2019 both years when he took different teams from mediocre eastern conference teams to 1st seeds. 

Just to be clear, I put A LOT of value in the playoffs. I love play off basketball, and the teams I route for I don't want to just have a great regular season followed by a 1st round exit. 

Does this have to do with the way fans relate to players vs. the way they relate to coaches?

If you get off to a horrific start, that’s enough to make a player or coach change. But if you roll along fine, have to deal with injuries, or stay at least competitive, it’s harder to judge off regular season.  Playoffs are a much more accurate gauge. That’s the moment you get to see coaches under pressure. How do they make adjustments? How do they handle adversity? Can they get the most out of their best players in the big moments when it matters?  Playoff results are much more telling for what a coach actually is. For example, guys like Mike Budenholzer and Doc Rivers have strange rotations that usually get picked apart. Coaches like Ty Lue are shown to be full of adjustments and making minutes count. Coaches like Spo and Pop find a way to get the most out of their players and run good systems when it matters.  So unless the regular season is filled with locker room issues or bad starts, it’s much harder to gauge off of that compared to playoffs.",7,0.081,0.807,0.112,0.4098,6.12

The salaries basically match up (Simmons actually makes a few million less than Kyrie), which is probably the major roadblock for most trade ideas for Ben Simmons.  Moreover, this swap would give each team exactly what they want/need.

Nets: They address their greatest weakness - defense, with an All-Defensive first teamer.  I am personally of the opinion that Ben Simmons should switch to center, or at least the frontcourt, where his defense will continue to have massive impact and his shooting woes will be minimized.  Playing with two of the most talented scorers of the generation, if not ever, Simmons can stand in the dunker's spot all day and not ruin the offensive structure as Kevin Durant and James Harden do their damage from the midrange and long range, and he's there as a vertical spacer.  Plus, maybe he can pick up some tips from Durant and Harden and evolve back into a useful offensive player with a more reliable free throw.  All of this fails to mention that when Harden goes out, you replace him with an All-NBA player at point guard, and Ben Simmons durability shames Kyrie's.

Sixers: Shooting and iso offense - exactly what they need.  With Kyrie's excellent marksmanship, Embiid can permanently park himself inside and finally eschew shooting 3's, something he's verbally stated he dislikes.  When Embiid goes out, the Sixers will still be able to put points on the board with one of the league's best iso players and scorers.  Is Kyrie a defensive downgrade?  Sure, but the Sixers still have an All-Defense player in Matisse Thybulle - just give him a few more minutes (25-ish?) to paper over the deficit.  Plus the offensive upgrade from Simmons to Kyrie should make it a net positive even with more time on the court for a weak offensive player like Thybulle.

If you watched these playoffs and think Kyrie and Simmons have remotely similar trade value I don’t know what to tell you. Kyrie is the far, far superior asset. He’s playing at the peak of his game and an absolutely elite offensive player. Not to mention Ben Simmons doesn’t fit what the Nets want to do. The Nets want shooters who can space the floor for their elite scorers, Kyrie included. Defenses could double Harden/KD off Simmons and totally ignore him because he can’t shoot from anywhere on the court except directly underneath the basket.

I think mainstream basketball analysis ends up putting a lot of emphasis on the “superstar” and a lot of people do underplay the fact that it is 5v5. Neither CP3 nor Jimmy Butler are superstars, but they’re as close to “superstar” as you can get to not being called one.  What’s more important (imo) when taking about contending teams is how both these teams are constructed around that star, and how they exemplify modern NBA. Both teams have plenty of knockdown shooters (Heat: DRob, Crowder, bubble Herro; Suns: Booker, Mikal, Crowder). Both teams have strong defense at the wings (Butler/Crowder, Mikal/Crowder). Both teams have mobile/switchable bigs (Bam/Ayton). You hear about these traits in modern NBA analysis, and it’s absolutely no coincidence that these two made the finals. So in addition to the importance of superstars, the rest of the starters really matter, and can help (or hinder) your superstar.

Offense vs Defense","2021-08-07 6:57:14 AM","This [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/ofqosc/is_the_nba_making_a_mistake_marketing_players/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) got me thinking... Would anyone watch basketball played NFL style, with Defensive / Offensive teams?

  
Kinda like half court playground games. take a free throw to determine who gets first possession. No winners or losers out. Each team gets 3 minutes to score however much they can. Team A's offensive 5 versus Team B's defensive 5. Then give the ball to the other team, their turn. Take a break after 12 minutes. 

Keep taking turns, keep adding the scores, similar to how they do it currently for the All Star Game, for each quarter scores. It might lead to impossibly large margins, like this year's All Star, but that's where the defense would really have to put their stamp on the game, to ensure the scores don't become too much for their offensive team to overcome. 

Would this allow specialists or extreme GOATs to really shine? Like, how much would Steph and co. be able to pour in the 3s on a quintet focused only on stopping him? Or, how much would a team of Ben Simmons type players cause havoc on an offense? Or would a really good Offensive / Defensive Coach be able to finally show his true value?

Players wouldn't get played off the court as they could simply focus on their primary strengths - offense or defense. We have situational subs now anyway, but in this case we'd have a longer time to be in that situation.

KD is far from an elite defender He has never even be close to DPOY consideration, and he has never made an all defense team either. I would say he is above average on that end, but the term elite gets thrown around way too often when evaluating players on a skillset.

It is unknown what substance was used or what the extent of its use was. Harris can apply for reentry into the league after a year.


So I ask the question, is this punishment fair? Players have been given say 30 game suspensions for PED use which in my eyes is more serious than say a one time use of cocaine or meth as it affects the product of an NBA game. The guy is only 22 and was only in the league for a year, showing lots of potential especially after dropping 31 points in a game against Dallas back in April.

PEDs 100% will give you an advantage in basketball lmfao.  They can make you big and strong, which is the bit people are trying to argue isn't helpful in basketball (weird.)  I don't think you're getting how big and strong.  It's literal super human strength.  But also, PEDs can make you both fast/quicker and more importantly, give you better endurance.  They can make it much easier to play a 48 minute game.  PEDs will also wreck your body and lead to mental/emotional problems.  If the PED penalty is 30 days and the recreational drug penalty is a year+, then it seems like the NBA WANTS their players on PEDs.  They don't give a shit about players health.  Their drug policy is literally just about appeasing people with conservative values.  I also don't know the actual rules and am just trusting other comments in this thread lol. Now let's get to the hard drugs they are stigmitizing.  When you get injured, DOCTORS give you opiodes.  The NBA is stuffing their employees full of opiodes.  Opiodes are highly addictive..  It would be absolutely wild for the NBA to have a zero policy rule, considering this fact.  It's absolutely abhorrent for the NBA to not have some kind of short suspension/help you out program, at least for 1st offenses.  The NBA is literally forcing these drugs on these young men and its surprising more don't keep taking them when their prescriptions are up.  Once again, idk the real rules but am basing them on other comments. Adderall is an amphetamine and I'm sure a lot more of you have taken amphetamines than you're even aware.  LSD is definitely a recreation drug.  Cocaine CAN BE a recreational drug.  None of these should be one time you're done and a one time drug test doesn't mean abuse.  First test should definitely lead to a short suspensions, sit down, meet with a counselor at the least.  Also, as another comment brought up, alcohol can ruin your life just as bad, if not worse than all of these. I have no excuse for PCP.

There’s a lot of confirmation bias involved in that rhetoric. If someone who was “supposed” to win does, no one really thinks about it twice. This is one of the biggest problems with judging a player’s legacy on championships—skill gets you in the mix, and luck usually puts you over the edge one way or another. -It’s no coincidence that 2 of the 3 teams left in the playoffs are among the deepest teams in the league right now. Obviously rotations get pared down in the playoffs, but here’s the thing—if you’re counting on a team of 6 or 7 high-end guys to take you all the way through the playoffs, I don’t think you have much of a right to complain when some of your key players get banged up playing 40+ minutes every game and suddenly you’re playing replacement-level players significant minutes.

"nbadiscussion","Desmondo110","Leaders in Offensive RAPM (Luck-Adjusted) over the last 5 regular seasons (2016-2021).","2021-28-06 2:27:27 PM","RAPM means regularized adjusted plus-minus. **It does not use any box score stats at all**, the data is purely from on-off plus-minus numbers on a possession by possession basis over the last 5 years. A technique called ""ridge-regression"" is applied to the data to estimate numbers for how impactful each player is helping their team win (i.e score more points than the other team). The results are adjusted for luck due to 3 point and free throw variance which is proven to be slightly more accurate then leaving it unadjusted.

As you can imagine, over small sample sizes RAPM can be very noisy. However over a long period of time, RAPM stabilizes and provides results that much more align with the eye-test (at least on offense). Furthermore, due to the nature of the sport, estimating offensive impact is generally much more reliable then estimating defensive impact. An individual player (especially the star players) have much more control over their team's offensive impact than their team's defensive impact which is more affected by other teammates and schemes. Furthermore, many star players tend to coast more on defense throughout the regular season, which also casts more uncertainty into defensive impact numbers.  Because of this, I'm only going to list offensive RAPM here. 

Here are the [leaders in offensive RAPM](http://nbashotcharts.com/rapm5?id=1827831455) (Luck-Adjusted) from 2015-2016 to 2020-2021 regular seasons:

1. Stephen Curry (5.19)

2. James Harden (5.02)

3. Damian Lillard (4.83)

4. Nikola Jokic (4.05)

5. Lebron James (4.03)

6. Kevin Durant (3.88)

7. Karl Anthony Towns (3.54)

8. Bradley Beal (3.48)

9. Kawhi Leonard (3.28)

10. Kyrie Irving (3.12)

11. Chris Paul (3.05)

12. Jimmy Butler (2.95)

13. Trae Young (2.87) (**Drafted 2018, smaller sample**)

14. Kemba Walker (2.77)

15. Luka Doncic (2.61) (**Drafted 2018, smaller sample**)

Anything that stands out from these results? Any surprises? The guys that stand out the most to me are Damian Lillard and Bradley Beal whose offensive impact could be even better than what most people think. Lebron being 5th isn't too surprising to me because of his age and coasting in the regular season vs playoffs. Stephen Curry being 1st also isn't very surprising but it goes to reinforce how he's one of the most impactful players on offense of all time.","t3_o9tuox","https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/o9tuox/leaders_in_offensive_rapm_luckadjusted_over_the/",17,20,"t1_h3gj2bl","2021-29-06 10:02:03 AM","I'm surprised that Giannis isnt here given how important he has been to the bucks offensive scheme in his MVP years, with their 5 out Giannis ball attack.

Two top ten caliber offensive talents who are also top three defenders at their positions. That’s a huge asset to have on your team.  I’m most surprised by Jimmy Buckets on this list because of his lack of shooting but this definitely emphasizes his value as well given how strong of a defender he is. Far and away the worst shooter on this list.  I think I’m most surprised to not see Giannis on this list given his paint dominance and Buck’s regular season excellence the past three years. No Tatum was surprising too given the C’s have generally had strong offenses the past few years and he hasn’t had many offensive minded backups.

One of the fair critiques of Simmons is that he's no longer worth a max contract, but IMO that's not entirely correct. I think we have a partially skewed idea of who a max contract player should be, because the truly elite player have an artificially low cap hit. In a true fair market, guys like Steph and LeBron would be worth far more than what their current contract indicates, and guys like Simmons get unfortunately lumped into having higher expectations because their contract is similar to those elite few.

So my question is, how many guys would be worth far more than their current max contracts if the league didn't cap player's salaries?

My guideline for this was Michael Jordan's last contract for the Bulls. At the time, there was no cap for how much MJ could make, and in the 1997-98 season, he made just over $33 million. Adjusted for just inflation (and not league revenue) that comes out to $54.5 million. Another way of looking at his contract, is that MJ accounted for right at 54% of the Bulls $61 million in players salary that season. The current NBA salary cap is right at $110 million (excluding all the exceptions that let a team go over of course). That means by today's standards, MJ would have made just under $60 million. 

Using those numbers, and accounting for the fact I'm using prime MJ's value to set the market, I looked at who I think could sign a 1 year $50 million contract for the 2021-22 season. IMO, this was a good rough approximation for a current player worth about 85-90% of peak Michael Jordan. Here's my list in no particular order:

LeBron James

Kawhi Leonard

Kevin Durant

Here is the link to the preview : https://twitter.com/basketlemag/status/1414618600279887880
(the small text is not on the same subject though - so don't bother translating)

For context, Xavier Vaution is the ""boss"" of the NBA team working at BeIN Sports, the french official NBA broadcaster. The article states that audiences have doubled since last year, while in the same time we are often seeing awful TV scores on ESPN / TNT broadcasts.

Before subscribing to beIN sports (15$/month), I was usually watching the games at 1am on free websites either broadcasting ESPN or TNT, it was my only way to watch NBA back then because I was too cheap to subscribe. 

The amount of commercials in the games really made it unwatchable. To give you perspective, beIN Sports only run 3 mn commercial pauses at the end of each quarter, so it's basically 10mn of commercials on a 2h15 game. 

When US audience is watching Chris Paul in a State Farm commercial,Blake Griffin fooling around in an other or big fat Burgers with a shit ton of calories, beIN Sports analyzes the game with former players (Mahinmi, Micoud (from Georgetown, etc..)), shows 10 mn interviews with NBA players or former ones (ex: QRich, Jet Terry..etc) , fools around with funny Q/A games.. etc..

That was just some positive feedback I had to give to the few NBA broadcasters loving the game and not ruining it with shitty commercials,and I'm quite lucky to be able to enjoy it, but I feel really sorry for ESPN or TNT subscribers (Shaq and Chuck are funny, but TNT is still more Burger/Toyota/Verizon than Chuck/Shaq overall)

Sorry for the bad english overall, but I felt I had to share.

I won't jump to any conclusion on anything because I don't know the topic enough, it's just that I think the NBA product is not suffering from impopularity, it's just not entertaining anymore to watch when there are that many commercials.","t3_oiypio","https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/oiypio/vaution_bein_sports_audiences_have_doubled_in_one/",7,2,"t1_h4zzvqr","2021-12-07 8:42:30 PM","Thanks for sharing this.

I'm not going to pretend like I have some unique things to say, but I do have some thoughts, and hopefully other's have more insightful things to say.  

First, the Suns' guard tandem really shows the value of the midrange, even in this age of efficiency.  When defenses get tougher in the playoffs/finals, and when there is more time to game plan and prepare, the easy buckets and threes often get taken away, and having one, or even two players who can use screens, get mismatches, or even iso up and get to spots in the midrange and score is invaluable.  

Second, Giannis looked healthy, but completely disappeared for most of the game after a strong first quarter.  Suddenly, with 4 minutes left and the game pretty much out of reach, he became super active and energetic.  Very disappointing game for him, and for the Bucks, who just seem to be much more a great regular season team/average playoff team.  Giannis' game just is too limited it seems, he's got no versatility, and really looked like he didn't want to go the line.  Bud is at fault here too.  Giannis, not coincidently, was active (if not good, maybe) when Bud finally went to him as a center and played a small ball line up.  It was too little, too late, but we'll see it again if Bud is smart, so maybe we'll see it.  

Third, CP3 and Booker were really hunting mismatches on big men and feasting on them.  Bud either needs to change his defensive scheme, or play more Giannis at the 5, but that really seems like something Giannis can only do in spurts.  Paul was amazing in these matchups and really looked in full control of the game from the second quarter on.  We may see the worst contract in sports win the Finals MVP.","t3_ofjltq","https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/ofjltq/thoughts_on_game_1_2021_finals/",55,25,"t1_h4dj6q1","2021-07-07 10:25:42 AM","bucks are so darn mercurial i feel completely unable to evaluate them. they could just as easily win the next game by 40 as they could get swept, i swear.  suns’ defense looked really, really good. but MIL was also settling for 3s and contested mid ranges. as giannis’ knee improves the team will look different",16,0.018,0.795,0.187,0.8476,3.87

In 97' they replaced Shaq with a 17/10 center and fell to 45-37 and were bounced in the first round, despite an epic series from Penny.

You can do this over and over again for Shaq. The fact is his teams were average without him. Even when his superstar wings were out Shaq kept the team performing at an elite level; when he was out both Kobe and Wade failed to do the same. Penny was not able to do it in 97'.

However, where were Penny, Kobe, and Wade without Shaq in the middle? Kobe and Wade struggled to reach 0.500 without Shaq.

This is true even if you're talking about Steph Curry sitting on the Warriors ... and KD playing. With the rest of that team, they should have been great ... and they were merely pretty good. Not because KD couldn't lead a team with that talent to great places, but because everything they did was built around Steph's unique gravity. It's the same with Shaq. He was SO dominant during that period (if you weren't around, trust me - however dominant you think he was? He was more) that it impacted everyone on the floor. So, yeah, the teams had to completely switch what they were doing when Shaq was out, and teams struggle to make those adjustments on the fly.  The thing is, all the advantages that the Lakers have now? They had then. Superstars (both Shaq and Kobe!) forced their way there. Role players wanted to play in the city, knew they could make extra endorsement money and would have a huge national profile.  Also, part of what makes a team good is that guys are good IN THEIR ROLE. Guys like Robert Horry, Horace Grant, Rick Fox, Derrick Fisher - those guys weren't going to be all-stars, and if you asked them to carry a team they would struggle, but they were great at what the team wanted them to do. The Lakers basically had their pick of role players, and smartly didn't try to fill out the roster with stars, but rather with guys who would work well around Shaq (and to a lesser extent around Kobe).",2,0.047,0.761,0.192,0.9918,4.42

First of all I just wanna say that I don’t think players can magically just become great shooters in a year, even if they get drafted in a great environment. Scottie is most definitely an offensive project, but from the eye test this kid is really great at the intangibles.

There’s a reason why he’s been compared to Draymond Green, he makes smart plays and can score within the flow of the team.

The reason why I would consider taking Barnes 4th overall is because of his defensive prowess alongside OG.

First of all I just wanna say that I don’t think players can magically just become great shooters in a year, even if they get drafted in a great environment. Scottie is most definitely an offensive project, but from the eye test this kid is really great at the intangibles.

There’s a reason why he’s been compared to Draymond Green, he makes smart plays and can score within the flow of the team.

I give the nod to KAT because he is the best stretch 5/shooting big of all time and that skillset and ability to space the floor at the 5 is incredibly valuable. His criticisms are his poor defense, but his shooting is elite and his rebounding is pretty good.

Ayton has gotten praise for his great defense in the playoffs, but every opponent his team has faced in the playoffs has had major injuries to their team. Davis was injured after during game 4, prior to that he had 2 b2b 34 point games. Jokic and the Nuggets were down 2 starters and had to entirely carry the offensive load, which no doubt had a serious effect on his passing due to the lack of scoring threats, making it easier to put him on an island or just force his role players to hit shots. And the Clippers now have two injured centers who are DNP and despite having no true 5 to guard anymore, Ayton had his worse game of the series and possibly the playoffs vs Boogie and Batum. 

I just think that KATs skillset is more rare and valuable and allows the team to do a lot more than a traditional, yet very good big in Ayton. KAT has also had completely garbage teams around him for most of his career, minus one or two years, and poor coaching except for this last year. 

Ayton’s skillset is a lot more replaceable imo too, and I fail to see him becoming as dominant as the highest echelon of bigs in the game such as Davis, Jokic and Embiid just based on the eye test.

"nbadiscussion","lukadirkfan","Evaluating Ty Lue as a coach","2021-29-06 10:05:02 AM","There has been widespread appreciation for Ty Lue as a coach as the plucky Clippers have been fighting their way back into 3 consecutive series now. Heres my assessment of his coaching and would love to get other people's opinion on it too.

I'll start with the positives...

His players seem to love playing for him. They play with energy and new guys coming into the rotation seem engaged and prepared to play even if they havent been getting minutes previously.

Not afraid to make changes and adapt (eventually) and maintains calm demeanor even when under pressure.

Young players and players previously on the fringe like Mann and Jackson have become steady contributors. So good development/maximization of available talent (maybe good staff related).
 
However, there have been certain issues I feel which seem to have been masked by the deep roster and the subsequent success they've had so far and to an extent the injury to Kawhi. His insistence on playing Rondo has been a glaring one where in each series Clippers have fallen behind losing multiple close games at the start. Rondo minutes have largely been detrimental to the Clippers. 

His in-game tactics have been sub-optimal at times as well. Leaving Kennard in at the end of game 2 against the Jazz where he was relentlessly and successfully hunted by Mitchell while not even attempting a shot at the offensive end as Clippers went ISO heavy with their stars. Another example was putting out a completely non-shooting lineup after a dead ball situation with <5 seconds left to end the 3rd qtr. in the same game IIRC.

Decided to play Zubac extended minutes in game 4 against the Suns and once the outside shots werent falling, there didnt seem to be a plan B with the lane clogged. In the minutes they went small, they decided to play conventional defense instead of switching.

One explanation for the lineups and rotations has been that guys like Rondo and Boogie have acted as innings eaters, taking some minutes off the main players as they have played extended series and condensed schedule. However, there are two problems with that: One, instead of Rondo and Cousins, those minutes shouldve gone to guys like Mann and Batum who have been effective but have been underplayed at various points in the playoffs. Mann, moreso before his breakout performace against the Jazz. Two, had the Clippers not made these errors on the margins in close losses, its conceivable they could've wrapped up their series earlier and thus saving themselves from extra games and condensed schedule.

Some of these foibles have been papered over I believe  because they have the deepest roster in the league with 6-7 guys shooting~40% from 3, some of whom are excellent defenders as well. Multiple playmakers and shot makers in Jackson, George and Leonard, latter two being elite wing defenders as well and serviceable big men. 

Overall, I think I would rate him as a good to very good coach, definitely belonging in the top half/third of the league and the value over someone like Doc Rivers is substantial.","t3_oaciqc","https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/oaciqc/evaluating_ty_lue_as_a_coach/",7,4,"t1_h3h91ea","2021-29-06 1:08:51 PM","He’s only coached two teams and both had top superstar players with deep rosters. We saw once the team in Cleveland got younger, he struggled and got canned quickly. So it’s hard to evaluate him too much because I think he’s a beneficiary of coaching talented teams.  The glaring positives though are his belief and confidence instilled in role players and his willingness to adjust. Lue was a role player, so you can tell he values those guys as well. Guys like Reggie, Pat, Morris, Mann, and Kennard are playing meaningful minutes and Lue believes in them and gives them opportunities to contribute. It’s not like Rivers where he focused mainly on his stars and was stubborn about adjusting or doing something different. I feel like that’s something Ty picked up from Phil Jackson. He manages all sorts of personalities well and gets the most out of everyone he can.  To me, he’s a top 10 coach currently in the league. He shows a willingness to adjust and he seems to be well-versed on what to do at certain times. Plus he knows how to motivate stars and role players. That’s important in the NBA. I still am unsure he could coach any team in the league to success, for example the Kings or Magic, or someone younger. But he’s a good Phil Jackson type that knows how to manage talented teams.",8,0.041,0.73,0.229,0.9924,7.29

Dale Ellis (Mavs -> Sonics - check out the jump in his stats) 2. Kevin Johnson (Cavs -> Suns) 3. The late great Drazen Petrovic (Blazers -> Nets). Drazen actually never technically made an All-Star game but he was Third-team All-NBA which is more impressive and he woulda been a multiple time All-Star had he not died early. Drazen was actually screwed over in Portland. Had Portland realized his talent and played him alongside Drexler (instead of going big with Williams/Duckworth), they would have won a few NBA Finals. Kevin Johnson’s situation is very similar to Oneyka’s situation (who’s currently the bench player here, not Collins). He was stuck behind Mark Price and Ron Harper (and he would have never gotten the chance to move ahead of them). Luckily Cavs were competing for a title (that they never got), so he became expendable for a veteran upgrade (which might happen with Oneyka). KJ was “smart” (in terms of his propelling his career) enough to basically whine and complain though - I don’t see that with Oneyka.",10,0.074,0.794,0.132,0.9351,3.8200000000000003

Example: The Hawks have Clint Capela and Onyeka Okongwu, and so the management is indicating that they aren't willing to pay out for John Collins, mainly because they know they have to pay a few other players next year. So Collins is probably going to walk.

The NBA has published voting ballots after all awards have been announced since the 2014 season. I'd previously posted about the [most contrary voters in the history of public ballots](https://np.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/j7dv7k/oc_whos_the_most_contrarian_voter_in_the_history/), so I already had a database to work with. There isn't much variation in how the NBA presents its voting PDFs so extracting the 2021 results & appending them to the previous years wasn't too difficult.

Next, I had to prepare the data into a friendlier format:

* cleaning player names
   * some years have the team suffixed within parentheses while other years are suffixed after two dashes: (HOU) vs -- HOU in essence
* pivoting the data
   * the data is originally set up so that each row is a writer's full ballot for one award
   * seems unnecessary to count by each column & then sum, so I thought it best to transform the data so each row is a writer selection
* adding points given (2 for first team, 1 for second team) and positions

With the data ready, it was time to dive in! I summed each player's total by year & position to get a positional points variable. Secondly, I summed the positional points variable by year & player to get a player's total points, and took the position of the max positional points.

For example, Anthony Davis got 34 centre points & 24 forward points in 2017. So he has a total of 58 vote points and would be listed at centre. This is the same system that the NBA has used, although it has been derided in the All-NBA context: Jayson Tatum this year & Khris Middleton last year have both missed out on 3rd team All-NBA even though their total points were higher than the 3rd team guards. Tatum & Middleton had their votes split between forward & guard.

After this, it was just a simple case of taking the centre with the 3rd-highest vote tally, and the forwards/guards with the 5th & 6th highest vote tallies. Here's the results!

They have holes at the SF position and the C position. Kemba is on the roster as of right now, but likely isn’t there long term.

"nbadiscussion","Banestar66","The idea that Shaq played on loaded teams for his entire career is dumb.","2021-28-06 9:06:25 AM","How loaded were Shaq's teams? Look at how his teams fared without him...The 96' Magic managed to stay afloat when he was out but that was the exception and took an MVP-caliber campaign by Penny (he was 3rd in MVP voting that year--ahead of Hakeem and Pippen). In 97' they replaced Shaq with a 17/10 center and fell to 45-37 and were bounced in the first round, despite an epic series from Penny.

The 2000-2002 Lakers were 13-12 with Kobe, without Shaq. How did they do with Shaq, without Kobe? 25-6.

How about Miami without Shaq?

2005: 6-3 2006: 10-13 2007: 19-23

In 2007 Wade missed considerable time. How did Miami do with Shaq, without Wade? 16-8. How about Miami with Wade, without Shaq? 18-17.

You can do this over and over again for Shaq. The fact is his teams were average without him. Even when his superstar wings were out Shaq kept the team performing at an elite level; when he was out both Kobe and Wade failed to do the same. Penny was not able to do it in 97'.

Also, Shaq's longevity is so underrated on this site and many others.

And in 2005-06, he put up 20/9/2/0/2 on 60% in only about 31 MPG.

Shaq is diminished by many due to allegedly poor longevity (the guy was still good in 2007--17/7 on 59% in 28 mpg, had a down year in 2008 but had a renaissance in 2009 with an 18/8 season) and because he played with Penny, Kobe, and Wade. However, where were Penny, Kobe, and Wade without Shaq in the middle? Kobe and Wade struggled to reach 0.500 without Shaq.

Penny managed without Shaq for a period in 96'--but the team collapsed when they lost Shaq permanently in 97', despite getting a 17/10 player to replace him (kind of like the Heat getting Deng for LeBron).","t3_o9ncs5","https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/o9ncs5/the_idea_that_shaq_played_on_loaded_teams_for_his/",0,7,"t1_h3d05er","2021-28-06 1:21:38 PM","I don’t know why but it seems like (maybe because in the post Jordan era non bigs are given benefit of the doubt the way bigs used to be) this is a common thing with bigs. I get it whenever I try to argue Kareem’s case all time. People use Big O and Magic to devalue him ignoring that in thirteen seasons those guys played in their careers without him not once did they win a chip. I never hear anyone bring up 89-90 when all the elements of Showtime were intact and many in their prime except Kareem (who already was diminished from even a few years prior) had retired and they’d drafted Divac who had a solid rookie campaign. But that small change at one position took Lakers from the Finals three years in a row to losing in five in the Conference Semis. All the evidence is that Kareem was more and not less important to Showtime than most think yet many still try to argue he’s less important than many think. I think it’s the same way with Shaq. People have this habit of talking about favoring “greatest peak” over greatest career yet no one ever talks about Shaq having arguably greatest individual season to result in a championship in 99-00 when talking about “greatest peak”. I’m kinda rambling but when it comes down it I’d say it’s most about bias against bigs in all time discussions in the modern era.",1,0.091,0.764,0.145,0.96,2.95
"nbadiscussion","Remarkable-Community","Thoughts on the Booker-Pat Bev out of bounds call?","2021-23-06 10:09:44 AM","Since the game last night I have heard a lot of discussion about the out of bounds call (where Booker was handling the ball, Bev poked it out, and it was actually off Booker).

On one hand, some people support the call, because they got it right.  It was clearly off Booker.  By the letter of the law, that means it’s Clippers ball.

However, some people don’t love it because it “feels wrong.”  There was a similar call at the end of the Texas Tech vs UVA national championship game a few years ago.  I’ve heard arguments such as “they give the ball to the offense on similar plays throughout the game” and “you’d get laughed off the court trying to convince somebody in a game of pickup that was the right call.”  

What do people think of the call, and if you dislike it, is it possible to fix (perhaps something like how the sweep-through foul is no longer a shooting foul)?

I don’t think defenders should be rewarded for just swiping at the ball - they should have to get a strip and keep it inbounds/keep possession. Since the hand is an extension of the ball, nearly any swipe initiated by the defender while the offensive player has their hand on the ball will result in the ball going off the offensive player, which I think currently rewards somewhat sloppy defense. I would like to see the rule changed to something more like whoever initiated the motion that resulted in the ball going out of bounds is responsible and the other gets the ball. I could see however how this might be difficult to officiate.",15,0.056,0.756,0.189,0.9452,4.390000000000001
