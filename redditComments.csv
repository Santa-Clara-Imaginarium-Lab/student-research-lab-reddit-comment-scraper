In fact, based on several studies that I will not link here because they might not actually exist, diversity hires are less productive than everyone else and are literally the leading cause of AIDS.

nbadiscussion,fskier1,How might Shaq's career after 2005 have been different if he had stayed fit and played more?,2021-28-06 2:06:56 AM,"**Shaq's career stats (that I will be using for the purposes of this post):**

|Games|Career PPG|Career Points|
|:-|:-|:-|
|1207|23.7|28,596|

&#x200B;

From the 1993 to 2005 Season, Shaq averaged 67 games per Season. **For the first scenario I will do the following:**

1. In the final six Seasons of his career, I’m going to continue to use 67 games each year.
2. Instead of using his points per game as they were, I’m instead going to take a different approach, and decrease his ppg by 1.5ppg each successive Season.

**Scenario One:**

|Season|Age|Games|Career Games|PPG|Career PPG|Points|Career Points|Notes|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Till 2005|20 - 32||882||26.7||23,583||
|2006|33|67|949|21.4|26.4|1454|25,037||
|2007|34|67|1016|19.9|25.9|1333|26,370||
|2008|35|67|1083|18.4|25.5|1233|27,603||
|2009|36|67|1150|16.9|25.0|1133|**28,736**|**Surpassed total career points.**|
|2010|37|67|1217|15.4|24.5|1032|29,770||
|2011|38|67|1284|13.9|23.9|931|30,701||

&#x200B;

**Now I’m going to assume Shaq:**

1. Ends up playing 20 Seasons instead of 19.
2. Plays 70 games per Season for his remaining seven Seasons (after 2005).
3. Decreased his ppg by 1ppg each year instead of 1.5.

**Scenario Two:**

&#x200B;

|Season|Age|Games|Career Games|PPG|Career PPG|Points|Career Points|Notes|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Till 2005|20 - 32||882||26.7||23,583||
|2006|33|70|952|21.9|26.4|1533|25,116||
|2007|34|70|1022|20.9|26.0|1463|26,579||
|2008|35|70|1092|19.9|25.6|1393|27,972||
|2009|36|70|1162|18.9|25.2|1323|29,295|**Surpassed total career points.**|
|2010|37|70|1232|17.9|24.8|1253|30,548||
|2011|38|70|1302|16.9|24.4|1183|31,731|**Would be fourth leading scorer of all time in 2011.**|
|2012|39|70|1372|15.9|23.9|1113|32,844|**Would be third leading scorer of all time in 2012, surpassing Michael Jordan.**|

nbadiscussion,addictivesign,What is the future of the Clippers?,2021-27-06 11:05:25 PM,"They’re currently down 3-1 in the WCF to the Suns in a series where they’re more than likely to lose. They have an aging and injury prone Kawhi Leonard who has mysterious handlings of his injuries and doesn’t seem like much of a team leader. They have Paul George who has been better at times this postseason, but has also still come up short at times where the moment needs him to come through. It seems like another wasted year in the Paul George-Kawhi Leonard era. 

A few things going for them: Terance Mann is developing into a fine-caliber role player. Reggie Jackson is playing some of his best basketball ever. Tyronn Lue is proving to be an upgrade at head coach over Doc Rivers. They seem to be a more resilient team than we’re used to. 

But they’re a team capped out and low on realistic flexibility going forward. Kawhi and Ibaka have POs. Jackson and Batum are UFAs this offseason. Most of their best draft capital was given to OKC in the PG trade. Teams such as the Lakers, Warriors, and Nuggets should be healthier in the West next season and will make the Clips path harder. 

I just don’t know what this team looks like in the future. They’re coming up short in their present iteration, and have aging superstars along with tough competition, but also have made some positive steps this season. What should they do going forward? How much longer do you keep the Kawhi-PG duo together?

I know refs don’t always call all violations-traveling and 3 second rules come to mind. But watching refs hold the ball, ready to go, until Giannis finishes his pantomime free throw practice, and then almost never calling a violation when his shots go over 10 seconds is astonishing to me. I don’t watch every game, so maybe they have cut others this same slack, but I haven’t seen anything like it in any game I’ve watched this year. In that sense, the failure of the refs to follow the rule is uniquely benefiting a single team, and is therefore not the same as the laxity in the rules listed above, where they don’t strictly apply the rule even as most teams show violations. That’s a random following of the rule; this allowance for Giannis is a specific act that is repeated multiple times a game. It also seems like the ref standing and waiting for Giannis to be ready, while everyone else on the court is ready and waiting, constitutes a delay of game. A player or coach would certainly get dinged for that kind of delay, wouldn’t they? Even a recent nba last 2 minute report listed two 10 sec violations as Incorrect NonCalls. How are the referees allowed to continue exhibiting such bias in favor of only one team in their refusal to follow this rule for this single player? I’ve seen arguments that they won’t change now because they set precedent throughout the season-that would work if this happened across the board to most teams, but it doesn’t. It is a delay of game, committed willfully and repeatedly by refs, to the benefit of a single player and a single team.

nbadiscussion,Hurricanemasta,The obvious Ben Simmons trade,2021-24-06 2:27:48 PM,"With the recent [reports](https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2944958-report-nets-brass-was-upset-with-kyrie-irving-gm-would-listen-to-trade-offers) of the Nets front office possibly being open to discussing trading Kyrie Irving this offseason, I think the obvious deal is Ben Simmons for Kyrie - straight up. The salaries basically match up (Simmons actually makes a few million less than Kyrie), which is probably the major roadblock for most trade ideas for Ben Simmons. Moreover, this swap would give each team exactly what they want/need.
Nets: They address their greatest weakness - defense, with an All-Defensive first teamer. I am personally of the opinion that Ben Simmons should switch to center, or at least the frontcourt, where his defense will continue to have massive impact and his shooting woes will be minimized. Playing with two of the most talented scorers of the generation, if not ever, Simmons can stand in the dunker's spot all day and not ruin the offensive structure as Kevin Durant and James Harden do their damage from the midrange and long range, and he's there as a vertical spacer. Plus, maybe he can pick up some tips from Durant and Harden and evolve back into a useful offensive player with a more reliable free throw. All of this fails to mention that when Harden goes out, you replace him with an All-NBA player at point guard, and Ben Simmons durability shames Kyrie's.
Sixers: Shooting and iso offense - exactly what they need. With Kyrie's excellent marksmanship, Embiid can permanently park himself inside and finally eschew shooting 3's, something he's verbally stated he dislikes. When Embiid goes out, the Sixers will still be able to put points on the board with one of the league's best iso players and scorers. Is Kyrie a defensive downgrade? Sure, but the Sixers still have an All-Defense player in Matisse Thybulle - just give him a few more minutes (25-ish?) to paper over the deficit. Plus the offensive upgrade from Simmons to Kyrie should make it a net positive even with more time on the court for a weak offensive player like Thybulle.
And best of all, we the fans get two more complete championship contenders that boost the East further on to the level of the Western contenders. Everybody wins!",t3_o7aely,https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/o7aely/the_obvious_ben_simmons_trade/,4,22,t1_h2zunko,2021-25-06 6:55:49 AM,"I've been watching the NBA long enough to know that its history is littered with ""coulda woulda shoulda"", so for me, the idea that the Nets are so good when healthy that they should fairly easily cruise to a title next year if healthy simply doesn't hold water. Could the Sonics have won in '96 if they'd put Payton on Jordan earlier in the series? Would the Lakers have beaten the Pistons in '89 if Magic hadn't gotten injured? Should the '11 Heatles - with three Hall of Famers - have handled the Mavs with ease? Do I believe this trade is realistic? Of course not. Most of the trades discussed on reddit are not. Philly is going to struggle mightily finding any trading partner for Ben Simmons, and Kyrie has enough connections with the Nets to supersede any inclination Sean Marks may have to ""listen to offers"". My basic assertions are these - Kyrie fits wonderfully on the Sixers, Ben Simmons fits wonderfully on the Nets, both teams get demonstrably better, and the salaries match. If the GMs of these two teams were HurricaneMarks and DarrylMasta, I would pull the trigger on this so fast your head would spin. Personally, I believe that running it back is only a real strategy for a young team who lacks cohesion, and even then it's a strategy to get better, not win a title. NBA teams need to push the envelope every year just to keep up, and you don't have to look very far in the past to see instances where it paid off. Could the Raptors have simply run it back in '19 with their 59-win team? Would the Warriors have been just as well off keeping Harrison Barnes after a season in which they won 73? Should the '18 Nets continue to develop their young core in the hopes of climbing the Eastern ranks? After the 2012 finals, everyone thought the Thunder would be the next dynasty, and they they were destined for at least a handful of titles, but things happen. They ran it back again and again without making moves to become demonstrably better and they never sniffed the finals again. For my imagination, this is an interesting and plausible deal, and I'd tune in to the Sixers and Nets much more frequently than I do now because they'd both be more complete teams without redundant or deeply flawed for their system's players.

nbadiscussion,LeMickey_Jorfraud,Reactive basketball to the space and pace era,2021-03-07 6:45:23 PM,"Almost every professional sport goes through cycles of innovative, proactive offence, preceded by intelligent, reactive, disciplined defence. Early to mid 2000s football (soccer) was characterised by tactful defence, which I think made the star players appear better than they perhaps were relative to this era, followed by an offensive explosion such as Pep Guardiola’s Barcelona. Tennis saw this as well with Federer’s proactive serve and volley style, in combination with an elite all around game, preceded by Novak Djokovic’s more reactive you’re gonna have to try your absolute hardest on every point to beat me given I can return everything. 

How do you see the defensive response to the space and pace era of basketball evolving over the next few years? I think it is not in doubt that in this current era of basketball, the elite offensives of teams far surpasses the defence. Will this come in the form of perhaps a change to spacing through rule changes e.g. changing the 3 point line to eliminate corners 3s. Or perhaps this is not a large concern given the variability seen in 3 point shooting, particularly in the playoffs.

Nowadays it is not a viable strategy as players cannot cover enough ground to deal with the precision of players hitting from the baseline. I feel like this change was more due to technology than a strategy revolution like the other sports. I think the only thing the NBA can do is the rule changes they were discussing to stop offensive players from running/jumping into defenders. I definitely would like to see a return of some more physical defense. The offensive game has progressed so much and with so many shooters on the court, it is way harder to stop stars nowadays.

They struggled attacking the basket. Players like Capela and Collins were constantly clogging up the paint. Capela could provide some sort of gap spacing as he normally stands around the dunker spot and he can always punish defenses when they help off him with lops. Yet, the same thing can't be said for Collins with his way below average 3 point shooting. And I do believe John Collins won't have any meaningful role in this team in the future, given how much he struggled getting his shot and attacking the basket and Capela having much bigger of an impact in the role Collins was supposed to play.
&#x200B;
Therefore, I could see a trade happening with Minnesota. I know Towns still has some years in this contract, but his timeline with Minnesota seems unreparable at this point. Edwards seems to be the focus of their future and I don't see a way that team starts contending anywhere in the near future. So there's a chance they cash him out and get some pretty good young talent along side their young core. &#x200B;
Karl Anthony Towns and Hernangomez for John Collins Sign and Trade, Clint Capela, Kevin Huerter, Cameron Reddish, the 20th pick in this year's draft, 2021 Swap and a 2022 First
&#x200B;
I think this move really fixes a lot of issues for both teams. The hawks are getting a superstar next to young who can give them extra spacing, allowing their guards and forwards to finish inside. They still can get some defense with Okongwo depending on how he turns out, but he might juts end up being a great back up center for a while.
The Timberwolves are getting a really good young core to build around with. Collins would fit amazing with Russell and Edwards, Cam Reddish has a lot of potential still and Kevin Huerter would easily be a starting small forward for a possible contention rotation. They still get a lot of assets in return for it with the picks and Clint can easily be traded for a good young package for teams who are looking to start contending and lack big man rotation, aka the Hornets.

To be able to talk to calmly yet with such inspiration and connecting to a young player just shows his ability to bring the best out of young players.

I think the energy they bring to the table without putting up skull crushing eye popping box score stats has been really fun to watch.

I have also really enjoyed seeing some inexperienced young dudes go out there and hoop their asses off in the playoffs- Trae Young, John Collins and D Book come to mind.

I think overall though I personally have most enjoyed watching Paul George play this postseason. I love his impact on the court and watching his sort of “redemption” playoff run has added an emotional component I very much appreciate. Their have been some other big performances by other role players and George sometimes shoots like shit but his composure and ability to smooth the game out is why this Clippers team was able to come back against the Mavs, Jazz and maybe the Suns. Every game has been pretty close, within reach.

This has been a really diverse postseason and I am very interested to hear who you have enjoyed watching play the most.",t3_o9nsuy,https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/o9nsuy/who_has_been_your_favorite_player_to_watch_this/,5,11,t1_h3cyocg,2021-28-06 1:11:25 PM,Watching Booker and Ayton ascend is really fun.

nbadiscussion,marinesol,Ben Simmons MIGHT have a breakout year next season.,2021-21-06 1:24:33 AM,"Based on all that has transpired these past few years, especially this season and this year's playoffs, we all have enough evidence to rank him accurately and accordingly to what he brings to the table. This year, this postseason, he's exposed entirely. In previous seasons, you could still argue that his upside outweighs his flaws and that he's still young back then, so more room to improve. We also put into consideration the coaching from his previous seasons, we are waiting for the right coach to unlock his full potential. Now. After having an excellent regular season as a team securing the first seed in the east, having a coach that is a lot experienced albeit being flawed, and having all of his teammates trusting him to co-lead them into contention, Ben actually had a great year. Despite seeing his game stagnated from what it was in the previous seasons, his strengths as a player actually stood out this season as he finishes as a runner-up in the DPOY voting, with stats/analytics supporting his bid for the award. But let us take note that this is done by him, being as chill as he is and being the same as ever. This postseason shattered all that momentum he was carrying with him, with teams consistently exploiting his lack of an offensive game, neutralizing his great passing as well. Most importantly, he allowed it to get into his head, and completely took away all his confidence as he's shown in this very crucial game 7 to this team. As a player, his value to his team, and his reputation throughout the league, he is at his all-time low right now. But I won't count him out yet, not until next season. Let us remember that he has the talent, the God-given athletic ability, and he is still in his mid-20s. This is somewhat comparable to the Pistons that MJ needs to overcome, LeBron's Boston obstacle, etc. If this event, happens to spark Simmons passion or whatever it is in him, this might unlock his potential for the upcoming seasons. This is the prime example of what having something to prove looks like, everybody will continue to count him out from this point out. He only has 2 options, succumb and get crushed by it, or to overcome it and become the ATG talent he was projected to be. It's disappointing to see a player of his caliber get destroyed like this, he has so much left in him for him to peak at that level. Next year will definitely be his career-defining year.",t3_o4qfxh,https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/o4qfxh/ben_simmons_might_have_a_breakout_year_next_season/,2,16,t1_h2istay,2021-21-06 3:06:48 AM,Ben isn't going to substantially improve until he gets into an environment that will break down his ego and shooting form into something functional.

I had this thought especially after watching his speech to Ayton after the third quarter in game 2. To be able to talk to calmly yet with such inspiration and connecting to a young player just shows his ability to bring the best out of young players.

nbadiscussion,YelIowmamba,How do you use the postseason vs. the regular season to evaluate players or coaches?,2021-24-06 9:00:52 AM,"I've noticed a reasonable discrepancy in the way fans/commentators value players vs. the way they value coaches. For instance, there is a huge group of people that defend players like Westbrook, Giannis and Gobert despite the fact that they have come up short of expectations in the playoffs. Coaches such as Dwane Casey and Budenholzer were both very successful regular season coaches that came up short of expectations in the playoffs and have received almost unanimous disapproval because of their post season struggles. We can't forget that Bud was the coach of the year in 2015 and 2019 both years when he took different teams from mediocre eastern conference teams to 1st seeds. 

Just to be clear, I put A LOT of value in the playoffs. I love play off basketball, and the teams I route for I don't want to just have a great regular season followed by a 1st round exit. 

Does this have to do with the way fans relate to players vs. the way they relate to coaches?

Or is it more about the fact that you can help if a player has short comings you can surround him with teammates that are capable of compensating, where as coaches are a more solitary entity?",t3_o73un3,https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/o73un3/how_do_you_use_the_postseason_vs_the_regular/,4,4,t1_h36s64q,2021-26-06 11:41:48 PM,"I put little weight to regular season.

On offense, try not to clutter other players, especially the player with the ball (unless you have a reason, like setting a pick). On defense, spacing (relative to your ""man"") is about finding a sweet spot: if you're too far away, you make it easy to do things (like score), but if you're too close, you make it harder for *you* to do things (like stop a drive).

Despite seeing his game stagnated from what it was in the previous seasons, his strengths as a player actually stood out this season as he finishes as a runner-up in the DPOY voting, with stats/analytics supporting his bid for the award. But let us take note that this is done by him, being as chill as he is and being the same as ever. This postseason shattered all that momentum he was carrying with him, with teams consistently exploiting his lack of an offensive game, neutralizing his great passing as well. Most importantly, he allowed it to get into his head, and completely took away all his confidence as he's shown in this very crucial game 7 to this team. As a player, his value to his team, and his reputation throughout the league, he is at his all-time low right now. But I won't count him out yet, not until next season. Let us remember that he has the talent, the God-given athletic ability, and he is still in his mid-20s. This is somewhat comparable to the Pistons that MJ needs to overcome, LeBron's Boston obstacle, etc. If this event, happens to spark Simmons passion or whatever it is in him, this might unlock his potential for the upcoming seasons. This is the prime example of what having something to prove looks like, everybody will continue to count him out from this point out. He only has 2 options, succumb and get crushed by it, or to overcome it and become the ATG talent he was projected to be. It's disappointing to see a player of his caliber get destroyed like this, he has so much left in him for him to peak at that level. Next year will definitely be his career-defining year.",t3_o4qfxh,https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/o4qfxh/ben_simmons_might_have_a_breakout_year_next_season/,2,16,t1_h2itcwj,2021-21-06 3:15:47 AM,"Good point, a change in scenery might be a solution as well.

nbadiscussion,Scoobersteve321,Could there be a way KAT gets traded to the Hawks?,2021-04-07 5:14:25 AM,"Although this year's Hawks playoff run was mighty impressive, specially given how much I and other believed in them from the get go, I think there were so visible weakness that tampered this team from being as dominant as they could be.
They struggled attacking the basket. Players like Capela and Collins were constantly clogging up the paint. Capela could provide some sort of gap spacing as he normally stands around the dunker spot and he can always punish defenses when they help off him with lops. Yet, the same thing can't be said for Collins with his way below average 3 point shooting. And I do believe John Collins won't have any meaningful role in this team in the future, given how much he struggled getting his shot and attacking the basket and Capela having much bigger of an impact in the role Collins was supposed to play.
&#x200B;
Therefore, I could see a trade happening with Minnesota. I know Towns still has some years in this contract, but his timeline with Minnesota seems unreparable at this point. Edwards seems to be the focus of their future and I don't see a way that team starts contending anywhere in the near future. So there's a chance they cash him out and get some pretty good young talent along side their young core. &#x200B;
Karl Anthony Towns and Hernangomez for John Collins Sign and Trade, Clint Capela, Kevin Huerter, Cameron Reddish, the 20th pick in this year's draft, 2021 Swap and a 2022 First
&#x200B;
I think this move really fixes a lot of issues for both teams. The hawks are getting a superstar next to young who can give them extra spacing, allowing their guards and forwards to finish inside. They still can get some defense with Okongwo depending on how he turns out, but he might juts end up being a great back up center for a while.
The Timberwolves are getting a really good young core to build around with. Collins would fit amazing with Russell and Edwards, Cam Reddish has a lot of potential still and Kevin Huerter would easily be a starting small forward for a possible contention rotation. They still get a lot of assets in return for it with the picks and Clint can easily be traded for a good young package for teams who are looking to start contending and lack big man rotation, aka the Hornets.

There’s a lot of confirmation bias involved in that rhetoric. If someone who was “supposed” to win does, no one really thinks about it twice. This is one of the biggest problems with judging a player’s legacy on championships—skill gets you in the mix, and luck usually puts you over the edge one way or another. -It’s no coincidence that 2 of the 3 teams left in the playoffs are among the deepest teams in the league right now. Obviously rotations get pared down in the playoffs, but here’s the thing—if you’re counting on a team of 6 or 7 high-end guys to take you all the way through the playoffs, I don’t think you have much of a right to complain when some of your key players get banged up playing 40+ minutes every game and suddenly you’re playing replacement-level players significant minutes.

For instance, there is a huge group of people that defend players like Westbrook, Giannis and Gobert despite the fact that they have come up short of expectations in the playoffs. Coaches such as Dwane Casey and Budenholzer were both very successful regular season coaches that came up short of expectations in the playoffs and have received almost unanimous disapproval because of their post season struggles. We can't forget that Bud was the coach of the year in 2015 and 2019 both years when he took different teams from mediocre eastern conference teams to 1st seeds. 

Just to be clear, I put A LOT of value in the playoffs. I love play off basketball, and the teams I route for I don't want to just have a great regular season followed by a 1st round exit. 

Does this have to do with the way fans relate to players vs. the way they relate to coaches?

If you get off to a horrific start, that’s enough to make a player or coach change. But if you roll along fine, have to deal with injuries, or stay at least competitive, it’s harder to judge off regular season. Playoffs are a much more accurate gauge. That’s the moment you get to see coaches under pressure. How do they make adjustments? How do they handle adversity? Can they get the most out of their best players in the big moments when it matters? Playoff results are much more telling for what a coach actually is. For example, guys like Mike Budenholzer and Doc Rivers have strange rotations that usually get picked apart. Coaches like Ty Lue are shown to be full of adjustments and making minutes count. Coaches like Spo and Pop find a way to get the most out of their players and run good systems when it matters.

I think the energy they bring to the table without putting up skull crushing eye popping box score stats has been really fun to watch.

I think overall though I personally have most enjoyed watching Paul George play this postseason. I love his impact on the court and watching his sort of “redemption” playoff run has added an emotional component I very much appreciate. Their have been some other big performances by other role players and George sometimes shoots like shit but his composure and ability to smooth the game out is why this Clippers team was able to come back against the Mavs, Jazz and maybe the Suns.

1. If you go to an NJCAA/JUCO Division 2 or 3 college, can you still transfer to the NCAA?
2. What if your school isn't known for JUCO basketball? Can you still be noticed by NCAA Division 1?

I'm pretty confident you can but the talent disparity is so huge (for D1 at least) that I'm sure this is a rarity 2. Unlikely, with the exception being that you're a freak athlete that's recruited out of high school and simply cannot go D1 because you're academically (or otherwise) ineligible. Colleges are always going to look at the best teams for talent first, but if you stand out significantly and impress in camps and when it matters, there's a chance. 3. Athletic ability, potential, height, playmaking, effort. You're much more likely to get noticed if your team is known for producing talent and winning, but if you don't play then it doesn't matter. 4. More often than not, if you have the talent, coaches will be contacting you. That being said, it helps to send out highlight tapes, go to showcases and camps against other top prospects, network with coaches - all this increases your chance of getting noticed.",3,0.037,0.664,0.299,0.9946,6.99

Basketball,Economy-Assistant-69,How to be more useful/effective given my skill set?,2021-02-07 9:27:38 PM,"So the main problem is I feel like I don’t bring anything to my team offensively. I’d say i’m an above average 3pt shooter and can knock down open shots but once I hit one or two the defense hones in on not letting me ever get an open look again. At this point what are my best options? I’m not confident in my dribbling or my ability to get past the defender who’s playing up on me. There’s a lot of games where I just feel like that annoying kid that just jacks up 3’s all game(especially if i’m not hitting) but I feel like I can’t do much else. 

Any advice on what I can do during the game to get open/set my team up? Also any advice on things to immediately improve on?

I was riding around on a Citibike in Brooklyn and as I was docking the bike to reset my 45 minute timer, I saw Kyrie curiously looking at the bikes. He noticed I put the bike in, used my key and got my bike back out.
He asked me “hey man do you know how this works?”.
I was a bit too excited and accidentally called him Kylie but he didn’t notice. I explained to him the basic rules of CitiBike but he kept acting like it was too complicated and didn’t make sense.
“So why did you put the bike back in just to take it out?”he asked
I told him “that’s because of the timer I mentioned to you. You have to return the bike before the time is up to avoid extra charges. You’re free to reset the time by docking it again”
He looked quite puzzled and asked if he could use my bike to test it out.
I told him all he needs to do is use a card and he can just get his own bike.
He refused and said he just wanted to try it out, hot but the bike.
Getting kind of annoyed I was like “dude it’s $3 for a bike”
He snapped back at me and said “if it’s only $3 why won’t you let me use yours?”
I said fuck it what’s the worst that can happen? So I let him hop on my CitiBike. This fucking guy gets on and starts strolling away and suddenly fucking guns t. I’ve never seen someone fast in my life.
I waited there for about 30 minutes but he never returned. I tried to call CitiBike and tell them what happened but they said allowing other people to use the bike is my responsibility.
After 45 minutes I got charged a late fee .. then again .. then a day fee ... the charges stopped but this morning I just woke up to a $1,200 charge on my account!! My credit card only has a $500 dollar limit but these fuckers somehow still charged me and now my credit usage is like 300%.

Blake griffin: all you needed to do was watch the nets series to understand. Pushing people constantly when they would box him out. Shoving PJ tucker in Game 7 getting him ejected when he shoved him back and got his 6th foul.

nbadiscussion,warboner65,Who has been your favorite player to watch this postseason?,2021-28-06 9:26:40 AM,"As a huge Draymond Green knob slobber I have thoroughly enjoyed watching Pat Bev’s and PJ Tucker’s deep postseason runs.

I think the energy they bring to the table without putting up skull crushing eye popping box score stats has been really fun to watch.

I have also really enjoyed seeing some inexperienced young dudes go out there and hoop their asses off in the playoffs- Trae Young, John Collins and D Book come to mind.

I think overall though I personally have most enjoyed watching Paul George play this postseason. I love his impact on the court and watching his sort of “redemption” playoff run has added an emotional component I very much appreciate. Their have been some other big performances by other role players and George sometimes shoots like shit but his composure and ability to smooth the game out is why this Clippers team was able to come back against the Mavs, Jazz and maybe the Suns.

nbadiscussion,deejpro11,Kawhi to the Hawks in FA?,2021-27-06 4:14:10 PM,"If Kawhi decides to test the market in Free Agency this summer, I think the Hawks should definitely be on his radar. Here are some reasons why.
1. The Hawks don’t have to give up too much to get him. As it stands now, in order to clear enough cap space to give him the max (~$39.35 mil.), the Hawks would only have to renounce all their cap holds (including John Collins’), and dump the salaries of Gallo, Kris Dunn, and Bruno Fernando; sending those contracts and a 2nd-rounder or two to OKC probably does the job. That isn’t nothing — Gallo and John Collins are good players — but that doesn’t compare to Kawhi’s value, and the Hawks get to keep their young wings (Reddish, Huerter, and Hunter) and their 1st for this year.
2. The Hawks have the pieces to build a contender right now. As is, the Hawks’ core of Young, Hunter, Bogdanovic, Huerter, Capela, and Reddish are already pretty good, and have proven that the playoffs aren’t too big for them. Adding Leonard makes the Hawks true title contenders, and that’s before them rounding out their roster with vet Free Agents using their MLE and BAE. The Hawks could realistically field a lineup of
PG: Young
SG: Bogdanovic
SF: Hunter
PF: Leonard
C: Capela with a second unit of PG: Ish Smith
SG: Huerter
SF: Reddish
PF: Bobby Portis
C: Okongwu / Vet Min. Big
That team is deep, versatile, and well-rounded: a good mix for playoff basketball. Note also that Nate McMillan seems perfectly capable as a coach and should be the Hawks HC long-term, which is a plus.
3. The Hawks have the flexibility to trade for a disgruntled star next year, and that could truly make them special. Unlike most other teams contending for titles, the Hawks have good young players on cheap contracts for next year, and have all of their draft picks. If a star like Bradley Beal or Zach Lavine demands a trade, the Atlanta Hawks can outbid other teams in order to acquire them via trade. They could really sweeten the pot with multiple young players, numerous first round picks, and an established vet while still being a title contender worthy of a star player’s respect and time. That’s something that the Clippers and many other contenders can’t do, which makes them significantly less capable of improving their rosters substantially. This is what makes the Hawks uniquely good as a free agent landing spot. Adding a third star to Trae Young and Kawhi Leonard in 2022 would be entirely possible and would make the Hawks a true force in the NBA for years to come.
Ultimately, I don’t think this will happen at all, but the Hawks have a lot to offer for Kawhi and would be a good destination for him. What do y’all think?

Odds are on him returning for his max. -Irrational OKC fan in me absolutely wants to see him leave for anywhere (ATL, MIA, NYK, wherever, hell let him go back to SAS for no apparent reason), and start the LAC decline immediately. -Normally I’d say you’d have to give up at least a 1st to get off those contracts, but considering the immediate value added to the LAC picks, Presti probably just asks for their ‘22 pick back and moves Gallo for a 1st elsewhere. -I’d love to see the backup plan rolled out for LAC if Kawhi leaves. Does PG ask for a trade? I don’t think they can create cap space which rules out a big deal for Lowry or one of the bigger FA’s. They can only trade their ‘28 1st and 2nd and that might be enough to get off Morris or Kennard but not both. I’ll end with it’s a nice dream for OKC and ATL but it’s probably not happening",2,0.06,0.841,0.098,0.9039,3.48
nbadiscussion,DavidKirk2000,There is a lot of chatter about how a Hawks / Suns Finals would produce a historically 'subpar' champion. How would you measure the comparative 'quality' of a champion vs other historical championship teams?,2021-30-06 10:25:00 PM,"At face value, the 1 or even the 4 seed winning a ring is pretty unsurprising. But a team winning with zero all-NBA players in a field that featured a Kyrie / Harden / KD super team, the current MVP, a 2x former MVP, a team with the GOAT and AD (and reigning champions), a team os assassins including PG and Kawhi ... now that IS a surprise. How do I 'quantify' that surprise?
One way you could do it is to look at Adj Net Rating, but that's not telling me the story I expected
Net Rating of the 2020/2021 Suns - 5.74
Net Rating of the 2020/2021 Hawks - 2.19
.
I looked into adj net rating of recent champions:
2020 Lakers - 6.16
2019 Raps - 5.38
2018 Ws - 5.70
2017 Ws - 11.41
2016 Cavs - 5.90

2013 Heat - 7.75
2012 Heat - 6.26
2011 Mavs - 4.68
2010 Lakers - 5.00

nbadiscussion,ParlayPfor3,Kobe Bryant Top 10 Playoff Games,2021-07-07 6:12:51 AM,"Kobe is a top 10 player of all time undisputed, for me personally I have him as the 7th greatest player of all time although I consider him and Shaq to be interchangeable in the 6th and 7th spot. Here are what I consider the top 10 playoff games in his career. I'm taking into account the production (statistics and performance), the importance (elimination game, closeout game) the stage ( Finals, WCF, WCSF) and the context. Although Kobe doesn't have as many iconic epic playoff performances like Jordan, Lebron, Magic etc, he still came through when it mattered most.

10. 2009 WCSF Game 4 vs Utah Jazz. 38 points, 1 assist, 6 rebounds, 16/24 FG. Coming off one of his worst playoff games shooting an anemic 5/24 in game 3, Kobe responded in Game 4 with a barrage of tough midrange jumpers claiming a commanding 3-1 lead.

9. 2009 Finals, Game 1 vs Orlando Magic. 40 points, 8 assists, 8 rebounds. 16/34 FG. Coming into this finals, people still doubted whether Kobe could lead his team to a championship without Shaq. So Kobe put up his one and only 40 point final game.

8. 2008 WCSF, Game 5 vs San Antonio Spurs. 39 points, 3 assists, 3 rebounds, 16/30 FG. One of his most underrated series, Kobe had to face a prime defending champion San Antonio Spurs. He closed the Spurs out in game 5 with this performance which included 17 in the 4th.

7. 2001 WCSF, Game 4 vs Sacramento Kings. 48 points, 3 assists, 16 rebounds, 15/29 FG, 17/19 FT. 22 year old Kobe put the Kings away with an epic performance including 15 points in the 4th when they came into the 4th down 4.

6. 2002 Finals, Game 3 vs New Jersey. 36 points, 4 assists, 6 rebounds, 14/23 FG. Lakers came into game 3 up 2-0, winning game 3 meant winning the series. Kobe had his best game of the finals and hit a clutch dagger jump shot to put the Lakers up 4 with 20 seconds remaining sealing the finals victory.

5. 2008 WCFR, Game 2 vs Denver Nuggets. 49 points, 10 assists, 4 rebounds, 18/27 FG. In terms of pure production this is no doubt Kobe's most dominant playoff game.

4. 2010 WCF, Game 6 vs Phoenix Suns. 37 points, 2 assists, 6 rebounds, 12/25 FG. Game 6 closeout game for the Lakers. Kobe scored 11 in the 4th including 2 incredibly tough fadeaway jumpers in the face of Grant Hill in the final minute with the iconic slap on coach Alvin Gentry's butt, securing their spot in the finals.

3. 2006 WCFR, Game 6 vs Phoenix Suns. 50 points, 5 assists, 8 rebounds, 20/35 FG. Easily would be his greatest playoff performance had they won but unfortunately they lost through no fault of Kobe's. He put up a Herculean performance but the undertalented Lakers lost.

2. 2004 WCSF, Game 4 vs San Antonio Spurs. 42 points, 5 assists, 6 rebounds, 15/27 FG. Heading into Game 3, the Lakers were down 2-0 vs the spurs. After winning Game 3, the Lakers NEEDED to win Game 4 as going down 3-1 most likely would spell doom for the Lakers. Kobe put up 42 points, the momentum shifted the entire series and the Lakers would win the next 2 and beat the Spurs.

&#x200B;

1. 2000 Finals, Game 4 vs Indiana Pacers. 28 points, 5 assists, 4 rebounds, 14/27 FG. I bet most people are wondering why this fairly mediocre performance is what I consider his greatest playoff performance. This is because of the context behind this game. Lakers came into this game up 2-1 in a pivotal Game 4, meaning if the Lakers won this game, they most likely would win the series. The game went into overtime in which Shaq had fouled out whilst the game was still tight. Kobe proceeded to score 8 points in the final 2 minutes including a putback dagger with 5 seconds remaining that iced the game, sealing the win. Considering the importance of this game and the stage along with the fact that he was only 20 years old, I believe this to be his best playoff game.",t3_ofimpa,https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/ofimpa/kobe_bryant_top_10_playoff_games/,15,10,t1_h4e1ssz,2021-07-07 12:42:04 PM,Pssh to not have Kobe in your top 10 is madness.

From the 1993 to 2005 Season, Shaq averaged 67 games per Season. **For the first scenario I will do the following:**

1. In the final six Seasons of his career, I’m going to continue to use 67 games each year.
2. Instead of using his points per game as they were, I’m instead going to take a different approach, and decrease his ppg by 1.5ppg each successive Season.

**Scenario One:**

There’s a lot of confirmation bias involved in that rhetoric. If someone who was “supposed” to win does, no one really thinks about it twice. This is one of the biggest problems with judging a player’s legacy on championships—skill gets you in the mix, and luck usually puts you over the edge one way or another. -It’s no coincidence that 2 of the 3 teams left in the playoffs are among the deepest teams in the league right now. Obviously rotations get pared down in the playoffs, but here’s the thing—if you’re counting on a team of 6 or 7 high-end guys to take you all the way through the playoffs, I don’t think you have much of a right to complain when some of your key players get banged up playing 40+ minutes every game and suddenly you’re playing replacement-level players significant minutes.

With the young Atlanta team coming up 2 wins short of the finals in their first year of competing in the playoffs, they have rightfully earned a lot of praise for their rebuild. While right now Hawks fans might feel disappointment from the elimination, there’s plenty of reason to be optimistic about the near future. Let’s take a look at how their cap table looks going forward and how they can keep the team together.

The Hawks currently have ~93.5 million committed for 2021-2022. John Collins has a cap hold of $12,411,906, so unless they renounce his rights, that brings them to ~105.9 million committed for 2021-2022.

**So currently, the Hawks are set to have around 6 million to work with in cap space this summer. This number rises to about 11 million if Kris Dunn declines his player option.**

They can use this space to bring back veterans like Williams, Hill, and Snell, or sign a free agent to bring someone new in.

**They will have to be strategic about how to use that space, however, as a long term deal might not be feasible.** If we assume that Atlanta has to offer a max contract to keep Collins and they also extend Trae at the max, their payroll gets pretty packed pretty fast. Let's take a look at their payroll for players expected to be part of the future.

So they’ll have some tough decisions next summer since they’ll likely have 141.4 million committed to just 9 players for 2022-2023 with Kevin Huerter needing to be re-signed on top of that. Extending Huerter this offseason is an option, but Atlanta’s front office might hesitate after committing so much to Trae and Collins. Plus, Capela, Hunter, and Reddish will all be up for new deals in 2023. This gets a little easier if they can retain Collins for less than the max, but that is yet to be seen of course. If worst comes to worst and they don't want to pay him so much, then they can still re-sign him and move him later since the cap consequences don't hit them hard until 2023.

Moving Gallinari’s contract next summer would save them 21.5 million for that year, so if they do need to duck below the tax it can be done without too much struggle. Another option to to deal with the high pay-roll would be to consolidate 2-3 of their good young players into one star sometime in the next few years. I thought about exploring some ways that they could open up a max slot for a big free agent, but it would likely require moving too many core pieces to be realistic and worth it. However, with all the young talent on the team set to be on reasonable deals, sign-and-trades will be a possibility going forward.

What do you guys think? How should Atlanta's front office handle their cap situation in the coming years? I think that they have flexibility to keep a great team together, but they will have to get creative as their rookie deals expire.",t3_odls7z,https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/odls7z/taking_a_look_at_the_atlanta_hawks_cap_situation/,385,149,t1_h439ij6,2021-04-07 7:58:34 PM,"Hawks could run it back the next 2 years I would want to keep Collins, but not match a max.

They are a valuable part of spacing the floor, even in previous eras. However this style is good for the NBA in terms of viewership. Deep threes, highlight transition dunks, alley-oop posters, are what people tune in for, especially overseas where the game is growing more and more every year. We’re going to see highlights become more of the game. Imagine Zion develops a good 3 point shot where he shoots 35%-40% on 3-5 shots a night. Then he’s going to be unguardedable, and people will want to see that. The only change which I believe is coming os going to be offensive players can’t get foul calls when they initiate the contact by jumping into the defender.

1. The Hawks don’t have to give up too much to get him. As it stands now, in order to clear enough cap space to give him the max (~$39.35 mil.), the Hawks would only have to renounce all their cap holds (including John Collins’), and dump the salaries of Gallo, Kris Dunn, and Bruno Fernando; sending those contracts and a 2nd-rounder or two to OKC probably does the job. That isn’t nothing — Gallo and John Collins are good players — but that doesn’t compare to Kawhi’s value, and the Hawks get to keep their young wings (Reddish, Huerter, and Hunter) and their 1st for this year.
2. The Hawks have the pieces to build a contender right now. As is, the Hawks’ core of Young, Hunter, Bogdanovic, Huerter, Capela, and Reddish are already pretty good, and have proven that the playoffs aren’t too big for them. Adding Leonard makes the Hawks true title contenders, and that’s before them rounding out their roster with vet Free Agents using their MLE and BAE. The Hawks could realistically field a lineup of
PG: Young
SG: Bogdanovic
SF: Hunter
PF: Leonard
C: Capela with a second unit of PG: Ish Smith
SG: Huerter
SF: Reddish
PF: Bobby Portis
C: Okongwu / Vet Min. Big
That team is deep, versatile, and well-rounded: a good mix for playoff basketball. Note also that Nate McMillan seems perfectly capable as a coach and should be the Hawks HC long-term, which is a plus.
3. The Hawks have the flexibility to trade for a disgruntled star next year, and that could truly make them special. Unlike most other teams contending for titles, the Hawks have good young players on cheap contracts for next year, and have all of their draft picks. If a star like Bradley Beal or Zach Lavine demands a trade, the Atlanta Hawks can outbid other teams in order to acquire them via trade. They could really sweeten the pot with multiple young players, numerous first round picks, and an established vet while still being a title contender worthy of a star player’s respect and time. That’s something that the Clippers and many other contenders can’t do, which makes them significantly less capable of improving their rosters substantially. This is what makes the Hawks uniquely good as a free agent landing spot. Adding a third star to Trae Young and Kawhi Leonard in 2022 would be entirely possible and would make the Hawks a true force in the NBA for years to come.

The San Antonio Spurs were the no.1 seed in the 2010-11 season boasting a record of 61-21, good for the 2nd best record in the league. Meanwhile the Grizzlies were the 8th seed with a record of 46-26. In the First Round the Grizzlies beat the Spurs in 6 games. When i first discovered this, i was perplexed that almost no one had ever mentioned this happening before. You always hear about the ""We believe Warriors"" beating the Mavericks in 2007 yet this had never come up before. So I went to check if maybe the spurs had injuries to the Big Three and found that every player on the team played all 6 games of the series except for Manu who missed out on only 1 game, so injuries weren't the reason why this loss was excused. I have 2 questions about this.

1. To the fans who remember this happening, that either watched the games or know a bit more about this upset, how did the Grizzlies beat the Spurs? 
2. How did the Spurs and especially Tim Duncan/Tony Parker get away with this? If Kobe, Jordan, Lebron, Magic, Kareem, Durant, Curry, Harden EVER lost to an 8th seed in the first round, their legacies would be PERMANENTLY destroyed. This would be brought up on every discussion about them and would never escape their legacies. Yet I'm willing to bet 95% of fans here either don't know this happened or don't care.

I think the RJ Barrett will be the most improved player next season. He is young. And in a good coaching environment.

And he has good effort on the defensive end too. He also grew as a player across the board this season. I think his growth will continue into the next season. He sticks out to me the most.
Still I am wondering if there are other people. Especially dark horse people like Jerami Grant and Christian Wood who not everyone sees coming. Who haven't had a 20+ point average until this season. Julius Randle had a 20+ point game in prior seasons. However his efficiency improved and that was a big factor in winning most improved player.
Who the most improved player is can make a big difference. Pascal Siakam's improvement helped the Raptors win a championship. Julius Randle's improvment helped the Knicks make the playoffs.",t3_ogeqbd,https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/ogeqbd/who_do_you_think_will_be_the_nbas_most_improved/,17,13,t1_h4ih9x5,2021-08-07 1:15:04 PM,I think LeVert is a candidate. A healthy season in a new situation where the team doesn’t have a clear leader Sabonis is great but it’s tough for big men to be the face of the team. If Levert can come in and fill the thought of Oladipo’s shoes I think he can do it. He averaged 20 a game with Indiana this season and 6 assists in his (short) time in Brooklyn this season. If he can put those together and improve a bit I think he’s maybe not the best choice but a solid one.,11,0.065,0.812,0.123,0.5644,4.23
nbadiscussion,Desmondo110,A comparison of FTA per 36 in the Regular Season vs. Post Season 2015 - 2021,2021-01-07 9:22:03 AM,"The NBA announced that it would be changing the rules to help curb some of the unnatural motion that players use to game the rules and draw fouls. The announcement specifically called out Trae Young and James Harden, but this could also be applied to many other foul baiters, like Joel Embiid, Chris Paul, and Kevin Durant. During the post season, it is not uncommon to see these master baiters complain to the refs after not getting a call that they may have gotten dozens of times in the regular season or earlier rounds of the playoffs. Are these players actually getting fewer fouls called for them in the post season compared to the regular season?
I wanted to determine if the players are actually getting fewer fouls in the post season. Using Basketball Reference player statistics for the regular season and post season dating back to 2015, I tried to accomplish just that. To take out any bias that might be created by small sample sizes, I removed any player-season, where the player played fewer than 500 regular season minutes and fewer than 80 post season minutes. I then calculated the number of FTA per 36 minutes in the regular season and the post season for each player-year. I then created a scatter plot with the X-axis as regular season FTA per 36 and Y-axis of post season FTA per 36. If players were getting fouled at the same rate in the regular season as the post season, a linear regression would have a slope of 1, so I added this ideal line to the chart in black. I also added the actual linear regression line to the chart, which can be seen below in blue:
&#x200B;
https://preview.redd.it/mt7s5l2efm871.png?width=561&format=png&auto=webp&s=830325af553aa1fa5bf2b8ec534417fff4474301
The linear regression model has slope of 0.91 and an intercept of 0.23, which indicates that a theoretical player who draws zero fouls per 36 in the regular season would draw .23 fouls per 36 in the post season. On the flip side, a player that leads the league in fouls drawn in the regular season would have the biggest drop in FTA in the playoffs. This can be seen by how the blue linear regression line clearly starts to deviate away from the ideal line at around 5 FTA per 36. It appears as if players that draw few fouls in the regular season are being rewarded with additional FTA in the post season and players that drew more fouls in the regular season are being punished with fewer FTA in the playoffs. This effect is likely the result of a combination of factors: defenders learning more of the offensive players foul baiting tricks over the course of a 7 game series and refs changing how they ref in the post season, and ""letting the players play."" It begs to the question if refs should ref the same way in the regular season and post season?
Some fun statistical nuggets from this analysis:
* In 2017 Dewayne Dedmon shot nearly 12 FTs per 36 in the playoffs after shooting 2.5 in the regular season. He made just over half of them.
* In 2020 Joel Embiid shot the highest number of FTs per 36 in the last 6 seasons, 14.6 because the Boston Celtics tried to defend him Daniel Theis and Enes Kanter. The Celtics still swept the series.
* Of the top 10 highest FTA per 36 in the regular season, Giannis in 2021 has the worst ratio of post season to regular season free throw attempts. 10.4 FTA/36 in the regular season compared to 7.8 FTA/36 in the post season.",t3_obpavr,https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/obpavr/a_comparison_of_fta_per_36_in_the_regular_season/,17,6,t1_h3pcyex,2021-01-07 10:20:06 AM,"This was super interesting. I wonder if poor free throw shooters being intentionally fouled contributes to the increase in free-throws for players who don't take a lot. I haven't done any real thorough research but quick glancing at Basketball reference revealed that some of the worst ft shooters in modern history i could think of, Drummond, DJ and Simmons all saw increases in attempts. Also that outlier at around 10 ft attempts who goes up to around 15, is that Jimmy?",3,0.089,0.818,0.093,-0.3818,2.43
nbadiscussion,alx69,Comparing Luka's and Trae's Situation,2021-25-06 6:37:56 PM,"I'd like to think that these two are going to go down in NBA history being compared to each other. They were both traded for each other on draft day. They both play PG (or at the very least, Luka's usually the lead ballhandler and playmaker). They are both known for their playmaking and general offensive prowess (over their athleticism and defensive chops). They are both touted as the face of their respective franchises, now and in the upcoming seasons. You get the picture.

Difference is, one is on a team that is in the remaining four franchises still vying for a championship this season, while the other is in offseason mode. I'd just like to get your opinions on their situations. Could it be due to the players themselves? Is it the lack of a true co-star for Luka (KP vs Collins)? Is it the construction for the rest of the team? Is it coaching? Is it the FO or the rest of the organization?

And I always found it weird, that the Heat and Suns weren’t really thought of as contenders just because they didn’t have one “Superstar” on their team although they had very well put together teams. 
Obviously in Football/Soccer or American Football or even Baseball (although I never really watched Baseball) it seems to be more important to have a chance at a title to have a well built team rather than one or two Superstars.

What is the big difference in Baseball that the Superstar effect seems to be more important than in other sports?

Yes, you need someone who can create and score when times gets though, there is no exception for that. On the other hand, this is still a team sport. Noone can drag a terrible team to championship, not even the biggest stars. You might not need other all-stars, but you need good role-players who fit to the role you assign to them. People simply assume that the star players automatically get those role-players and depth for the teams, because they are easier to aquire than Lebron for example. Still, this is not an automatic success, no matter what. Also Suns and Heat, specially the Suns are not considered contenders because of the last couple of years. People go with teams all the time when they are good for a few years (Bucks for example) or when they add big name players (Nets is the recent example). Suns were trash the last 10 years or so, so people expecting them to remain trash forever. I remember last year, when James Jones (Suns' GM) started adding good players to the roster. There were plenty of articles questioning his moves and they claimed that the Suns should focus on the draft instead.

nbadiscussion,Camctrail,8 observations from this post-season.,2021-24-06 11:23:22 AM,"1. Big Ball vs Small Ball centers
1. One of things that was interesting was how in 2020, it was a season of small ball centers taking center stage. Bam Adebayo helped sink the Celtics. Anthony Davis was a defensive force. The Rockets bet the farm on PJ Tucker. All these dudes, outside Davis, were legit small for the center, while Davis is skinny. All of them had some level of success.
2. In 2021 though, arguably what we're seeing is the rise of Big ball centers -- guys with some offensive skills but whose role is really to play D and PLAY BIG. Three of the four teams left count on guys who are Big Ball centers -- Ayton, whose a mobile 7 footer and the talk of the playoffs, Lopez, a sweet shooting big man who can box out and defend well, and Clint Capela, whose as close to a poor man's clone of Dwight Howard as any in the league. This is a big difference than from last year. I'm defining the big ball center by what they do on D not O, btw. 2. Superstar/Hybrid Centers have done well this playoffs, but if you ask them to do too much on offense, you didn't get out of the second round
1. The common thread of KD, Embiid and Jokic. KD saw his teammates go down and him step up to play big and score, setting up the offense. He did amazing. It wasn't enough, eliminated. Embiid had to also be the last line of defense, play big and set up his offense. It was too much, eliminated. Jokic saw his teammates go down, play big and set up his offense. MVP of the regular season, but that's too much, eliminated. If you compare this to Giannis, whose job was to play D reasonably well while also leading the offense, but not be the entirety of the defense at the rim and doing defensive rebounding, you see why he's still standing. It's going to be a while before we see a Shaq in 2000 performance ever again, something that should make us appreciate that ALOT more. 3. Rudy Gobert took the heat for Utah losing, but the reality is is that injuries caught up to the team's guards. 1. We all just like to make fun of him and it's okay, he should gain a thicker skin. This one's been done ad nauseam. Just remember -- to lose a 26 point lead, both your defense and offense must fail, and considering Reggie Jackson and Terrance Mann suddenly went super saiyan, from all over the court, while Don Mitchell just couldn't score anymore, I put that lost squarely on the guards of the team, and then on Rudy. Wouldn't be shocked if their injuries are worse than we think.
4. The Suns are a young team but play like an old team, they don't turn the ball over that much and that will likely be a big reason they beat the Clippers, if they beat the Clippers.
1. When I predicted the Lakers to go over the Suns in the first round, I was relying on old logic -- young teams don't win, even in wacky seasons. Well, that's because young teams have a tendency to self combust, turning the ball over under pressure, not knowing who should shoot on the last play, having some chemistry issues, etc. That and the Lakers thrived off teams turning the ball over last season, turning Russell Westbrook's dribbling into a liability, something that led to transition and then AD putting the other team in foul trouble. Well... I was wrong! The Suns have legit none of those issues of young teams and are pretty careful with the basketball! One wonders if this due to CP3 being a basketball wizard and changing his approach with age and playing on that OKC team last season. I genuinely believe this is the net effect of CP3, he's one of those beyond the box score leader types. 5. Injuries had a big effect, but so do role players stepping up.
1. People will write about this 1000x here so I'm not going to add anything. Have at it.
6. Ben Simmons scraped by on potential and now that's simply not good enough.
1. 10 years ago, Ben Simmons would've played like Rajon Rondo, and would have been expected to have similar levels of success to Rondo. This legit wasn't that long ago, Rondo was phenomenal for a while and the league isn't fully in ""everyone must shoot"" mode until the Warriors first chip, though teams were experimenting. We still have players that are relics of that era, though increasingly, they're less effective. 2. As his season is now over, it's time to assess Ben Simmons and the role of ""non shooting, defense first point guards."" One surmises that a point guard who can't shoot, can't effectively do his job despite being 6'10, because the defense sags back in the playoffs. This isn't so much an issue if you're going to be running at the basket all the time in transition. The thing with playoff ball is that, transition opportunities get limited by teams suddenly playing much more carefully with the ball.
3. This then begs the question, are we simply miscasting Ben Simmons as a point guard now? Is he ACTUALLY a point guard or is he... a point forward or small ball 5? I think this is the major question surrounding Simmons, which is A) what is he and B) how much should he be enabled by teams (the Westbrook question). It doesn't take a genius to see he's probably needing a rethinking of what he can do by someone. 7. Trae Young, Kawhi Leonard, Luka Doncic, Kevin Durant, Donovan Mitchell, Devin Booker are keeping Kobe's memory alive even better than the 2020 Lakers did, by shooting from the midrange so effectively. 1. Arguably, this should be the least shocking thing about the playoffs -- when the clock ticks down and the balls in the superstars hands, their job is to make silly, ridiculous shots, like Kobe did, like Wade did, like Jordan did, etc. The midrange is the superstars shot, it's the shot they get paid for, and I just listed 6 guys who having that midrange in the game is probably lifting them past their peers. 8. The Hawks vs Bucks is a major question of winning in the NBA -- is defense or offense more important? 1. The Hawks are a better offensive team that is an okay defensive team. Capela helps. But you know, their best defense is shooting and making shots, kinda like the old Rockets were.
2. The Bucks are a staunch SLOW IT DOWN AND TRY TO SCORE ON US defensive team, with some shooters to keep the game close if the other team is scoring a lot or make the game get out of hand if the opponent can't score at all. They have four good defenders in the starting lineup, and in a way, somewhat resemble the 2020 Lakers, only Middleton is in the AD free safety role.
3. I don't know who would win, my prediction even after game 1 is this is a knockdown dragout series, but there's legit two philosophies on the floor, and if the Bucks win it would match my perception that BAD ASS D wins titles. But they also could not win. I don't know. 9. The teams left standing all have a combination of young guys and veterans, affirming what I, a know nothing fan, have always believed in was the championship formula.
1.

The Rockets bet the farm on PJ Tucker. Rockets didn't bet the farm on **PJ Tucker,** they had no choice. Rockets made the mistake of trading for Westbrook. Now, they were forced to be committed to the micro-ball route and traded for RoCo and trotted out a small ball lineup that featured PJ Tucker, (who ALSO was DISGRUNTLED already for not being given a contract extension and for playing through a pinched nerve at center while standing a buck 6'5,) at the 5. I never understood why they were convinced that the micro ball of relying on a lot of shooters that didn't well shoot at all was going to work... RoCo had a terrible shooting year at 31.5%, Eric Gordon shot 31.7%. You really need some positive production rather than mass inefficient volume 3 point shooting. Honestly, I think the Rockets made a mistake trading away Capela. I never understood why they were so quick to get rid of him, getting rid of your best rebounder, shot blocker, and under 26 locked up for next 3 years. But Westbrook/Harden killed their spacing and rendered Capela useless. \_\_\_ >Bam Adebayo helped sink the Celtics. Bam Adebayo was *a beast against the Celtics,* but we were also featuring Daniel Theis at 6'8, who's also a small ball center himself.

The problem is his inability to stay healthy plus being banged up against the bigger bulkier 5's is not a good plan for his health moving forward. That's why the Lakers have been intent in getting someone like a Drummond or Gasol to spell him at those minutes. >In 2021 though, arguably what we're seeing is the rise of Big ball centers -- guys with some offensive skills but whose role is really to play D and PLAY BIG. Three of the four teams left count on guys who are Big Ball centers -- Ayton, whose a mobile 7 footer and the talk of the playoffs, Lopez, a sweet shooting big man who can box out and defend well, and Clint Capela, whose as close to a poor man's clone of Dwight Howard as any in the league. This is a big difference than from last year. I'm defining the big ball center by what they do on D not O, btw. Yeah, but a lot of these bigs all benefit greatly from a team that has a solid PnR partner in Trae Young/CP3/Booker. I will say Lopez is different, because he has changed his shot profile to help space the floor. &#x200B; >Superstar/Hybrid Centers have done well this playoffs, but if you ask them to do too much on offense, you didn't get out of the second round There's a common trend in these superstar centers not making it out of the second round, and **that can be attributed to missing their 2nd options or lack of one,** (Simmons, Murray, Irving/Harden.) Irving/Harden were in and out, and Harris/Aaron Gordon/Tobias Harris all played below their expectations. Your role players and 2nd stars need to show up to win. There's just too many talented teams that have plenty of depth and pieces to make it a tough series. (Hawks/Suns.) &#x200B; >Rudy Gobert took the heat for Utah losing, but the reality is is that injuries caught up to the team's guards. > >We all just like to make fun of him and it's okay, he should gain a thicker skin. This one's been done ad nauseam. Just remember -- to lose a 26 point lead, both your defense and offense must fail, and considering Reggie Jackson and Terrance Mann suddenly went super saiyan, from all over the court, while Don Mitchell just couldn't score anymore, I put that lost squarely on the guards of the team, and then on Rudy. Wouldn't be shocked if their injuries are worse than we think. Gobert can't solve the Jazz's weak perimeter defenders constantly giving up corner 3's, he defended pretty well. Terance Man just went ham, tip your hat off to him. When Gobert's forced to switch out and you're taking away and negating his shot blocking abilities, but you cannot also be happy with how passive at times, Gobert was whenever there was a smaller defender on him. Gobert is getting paid $40 million, he needs to learn maybe some basic post moves. Ayton, being switched on Morris would've been a field day for him. &#x200B; >The Suns are a young team but play like an old team, they don't turn the ball over that much and that will likely be a big reason they beat the Clippers, if they beat the Clippers. > >When I predicted the Lakers to go over the Suns in the first round, I was relying on old logic -- young teams don't win, even in wacky seasons. Well, that's because young teams have a tendency to self combust, turning the ball over under pressure, not knowing who should shoot on the last play, having some chemistry issues, etc. That and the Lakers thrived off teams turning the ball over last season, turning Russell Westbrook's dribbling into a liability, something that led to transition and then AD putting the other team in foul trouble. Well... I was wrong! The Suns have legit none of those issues of young teams and are pretty careful with the basketball! One wonders if this due to CP3 being a basketball wizard and changing his approach with age and playing on that OKC team last season. I genuinely believe this is the net effect of CP3, he's one of those beyond the box score leader types. Young or old, it doesn't matter. They have the talent + experience. I think it's also a given at this point that players like Jae Crowder or CP3 help change the culture of the team. They are great leaders or role players that you can fit on any team. It's no coincidence that Crowder or Trevor Ariza's been such a journeymen. Plenty of teams value dogs.",3,0.098,0.765,0.137,0.9941,3.37
