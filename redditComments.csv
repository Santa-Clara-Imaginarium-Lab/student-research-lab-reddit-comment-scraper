nbadiscussion,seemypinky,Ben Simmons MIGHT have a breakout year next season.,2021-21-06 1:24:33 AM,"Based on all that has transpired these past few years, especially this season and this year's playoffs, we all have enough evidence to rank him accurately and accordingly to what he brings to the table. This year, this postseason, he's exposed entirely. In previous seasons, you could still argue that his upside outweighs his flaws and that he's still young back then, so more room to improve. We also put into consideration the coaching from his previous seasons, we are waiting for the right coach to unlock his full potential. Now. After having an excellent regular season as a team securing the first seed in the east, having a coach that is a lot experienced albeit being flawed, and having all of his teammates trusting him to co-lead them into contention, Ben actually had a great year. Despite seeing his game stagnated from what it was in the previous seasons, his strengths as a player actually stood out this season as he finishes as a runner-up in the DPOY voting, with stats/analytics supporting his bid for the award. But let us take note that this is done by him, being as chill as he is and being the same as ever. This postseason shattered all that momentum he was carrying with him, with teams consistently exploiting his lack of an offensive game, neutralizing his great passing as well. Most importantly, he allowed it to get into his head, and completely took away all his confidence as he's shown in this very crucial game 7 to this team. As a player, his value to his team, and his reputation throughout the league, he is at his all-time low right now. But I won't count him out yet, not until next season. Let us remember that he has the talent, the God-given athletic ability, and he is still in his mid-20s. This is somewhat comparable to the Pistons that MJ needs to overcome, LeBron's Boston obstacle, etc. If this event, happens to spark Simmons passion or whatever it is in him, this might unlock his potential for the upcoming seasons. This is the prime example of what having something to prove looks like, everybody will continue to count him out from this point out. He only has 2 options, succumb and get crushed by it, or to overcome it and become the ATG talent he was projected to be. It's disappointing to see a player of his caliber get destroyed like this, he has so much left in him for him to peak at that level.

I think you’re right. Ben Simmons career has been completely analogous to lebron and MJ’s up to this point. It’s just some hurdles he has to overcome. For Lebron it was Boston. For Jordan it was Detroit. Maybe next year he’ll finally break out and try a jump shot. Or maybe hit two free throws in a row. Or, now I know this asking a lot, maybe, just maybe, he could dunk the ball when the only defender in the paint is a foot shorter than him.

nbadiscussion,ledouxx,Ben Simmons Trade for D'Angelo Russell?,2021-22-06 12:12:41 AM,"The Timberwolves are one of the only teams that could utilize Simmons' strength both on the offensive and defensive side. His DPOY level defense would obviously help their defense (comparing to Russell). Simmons presence around the paint in the half court offense often relegated Embiid to standing around the perimeter, but this is a much lesser problem with Towns on the floor. Playing Simmons next to 4 shooters would give space to drive or utilize his playmaking to find open shooters (he ranked near the top in the league in created 3-point opportunities). 

Philadelphia gets rid of Simmons and replaces him with a near All-Star-level point guard who is still on the younger side and who can consistently create his own shot, something the Sixers have desperately lacked from perimeter players. He is a bad defender but the sixers have a good team defense. A Russell Maxey backcourt might be problematic defensively, so it might depend on the role the Sixers want to give Maxey in the future. 

One problem might be the Russell - Towns friendship, however it's still a business and considering the long playoff drought of the Timberwolves, the Timberwolves might come to the conclusion that the current Towns - Russell pairing is not enough to compete in the playoffs in the West.

The trade would work out straight up but you could add picks in either direction obviously, depending on how you value the players",t3_o5gzkk,https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/o5gzkk/ben_simmons_trade_for_dangelo_russell/,15,15,t1_h2n22z4,2021-22-06 4:24:41 AM,"It would be a highway robbery for Minnesota.

nbadiscussion,ShampooMonK,8 observations from this post-season.,2021-24-06 11:23:22 AM,"1. Big Ball vs Small Ball centers
1. One of things that was interesting was how in 2020, it was a season of small ball centers taking center stage. Bam Adebayo helped sink the Celtics. Anthony Davis was a defensive force. The Rockets bet the farm on PJ Tucker. All these dudes, outside Davis, were legit small for the center, while Davis is skinny. All of them had some level of success.
2. In 2021 though, arguably what we're seeing is the rise of Big ball centers -- guys with some offensive skills but whose role is really to play D and PLAY BIG. Three of the four teams left count on guys who are Big Ball centers -- Ayton, whose a mobile 7 footer and the talk of the playoffs, Lopez, a sweet shooting big man who can box out and defend well, and Clint Capela, whose as close to a poor man's clone of Dwight Howard as any in the league. This is a big difference than from last year. I'm defining the big ball center by what they do on D not O, btw. 2. Superstar/Hybrid Centers have done well this playoffs, but if you ask them to do too much on offense, you didn't get out of the second round
1. The common thread of KD, Embiid and Jokic. KD saw his teammates go down and him step up to play big and score, setting up the offense. He did amazing. It wasn't enough, eliminated. Embiid had to also be the last line of defense, play big and set up his offense. It was too much, eliminated. Jokic saw his teammates go down, play big and set up his offense. MVP of the regular season, but that's too much, eliminated. If you compare this to Giannis, whose job was to play D reasonably well while also leading the offense, but not be the entirety of the defense at the rim and doing defensive rebounding, you see why he's still standing. It's going to be a while before we see a Shaq in 2000 performance ever again, something that should make us appreciate that ALOT more. 3. Rudy Gobert took the heat for Utah losing, but the reality is is that injuries caught up to the team's guards. 1. We all just like to make fun of him and it's okay, he should gain a thicker skin. This one's been done ad nauseam. Just remember -- to lose a 26 point lead, both your defense and offense must fail, and considering Reggie Jackson and Terrance Mann suddenly went super saiyan, from all over the court, while Don Mitchell just couldn't score anymore, I put that lost squarely on the guards of the team, and then on Rudy. Wouldn't be shocked if their injuries are worse than we think.
4. The Suns are a young team but play like an old team, they don't turn the ball over that much and that will likely be a big reason they beat the Clippers, if they beat the Clippers.
1. When I predicted the Lakers to go over the Suns in the first round, I was relying on old logic -- young teams don't win, even in wacky seasons. Well, that's because young teams have a tendency to self combust, turning the ball over under pressure, not knowing who should shoot on the last play, having some chemistry issues, etc. That and the Lakers thrived off teams turning the ball over last season, turning Russell Westbrook's dribbling into a liability, something that led to transition and then AD putting the other team in foul trouble. Well... I was wrong! The Suns have legit none of those issues of young teams and are pretty careful with the basketball! One wonders if this due to CP3 being a basketball wizard and changing his approach with age and playing on that OKC team last season. I genuinely believe this is the net effect of CP3, he's one of those beyond the box score leader types. 5. Injuries had a big effect, but so do role players stepping up.
1. People will write about this 1000x here so I'm not going to add anything. Have at it.
6. Ben Simmons scraped by on potential and now that's simply not good enough.
1. 10 years ago, Ben Simmons would've played like Rajon Rondo, and would have been expected to have similar levels of success to Rondo. This legit wasn't that long ago, Rondo was phenomenal for a while and the league isn't fully in ""everyone must shoot"" mode until the Warriors first chip, though teams were experimenting. We still have players that are relics of that era, though increasingly, they're less effective. 2. As his season is now over, it's time to assess Ben Simmons and the role of ""non shooting, defense first point guards."" One surmises that a point guard who can't shoot, can't effectively do his job despite being 6'10, because the defense sags back in the playoffs. This isn't so much an issue if you're going to be running at the basket all the time in transition. The thing with playoff ball is that, transition opportunities get limited by teams suddenly playing much more carefully with the ball.
3. This then begs the question, are we simply miscasting Ben Simmons as a point guard now? Is he ACTUALLY a point guard or is he... a point forward or small ball 5? I think this is the major question surrounding Simmons, which is A) what is he and B) how much should he be enabled by teams (the Westbrook question). It doesn't take a genius to see he's probably needing a rethinking of what he can do by someone. 7. Trae Young, Kawhi Leonard, Luka Doncic, Kevin Durant, Donovan Mitchell, Devin Booker are keeping Kobe's memory alive even better than the 2020 Lakers did, by shooting from the midrange so effectively. 1. Arguably, this should be the least shocking thing about the playoffs -- when the clock ticks down and the balls in the superstars hands, their job is to make silly, ridiculous shots, like Kobe did, like Wade did, like Jordan did, etc. The midrange is the superstars shot, it's the shot they get paid for, and I just listed 6 guys who having that midrange in the game is probably lifting them past their peers. 8. The Hawks vs Bucks is a major question of winning in the NBA -- is defense or offense more important? 1. The Hawks are a better offensive team that is an okay defensive team. Capela helps. But you know, their best defense is shooting and making shots, kinda like the old Rockets were.
2. The Bucks are a staunch SLOW IT DOWN AND TRY TO SCORE ON US defensive team, with some shooters to keep the game close if the other team is scoring a lot or make the game get out of hand if the opponent can't score at all. They have four good defenders in the starting lineup, and in a way, somewhat resemble the 2020 Lakers, only Middleton is in the AD free safety role.
3. I don't know who would win, my prediction even after game 1 is this is a knockdown dragout series, but there's legit two philosophies on the floor, and if the Bucks win it would match my perception that BAD ASS D wins titles. But they also could not win. I don't know. 9. The teams left standing all have a combination of young guys and veterans, affirming what I, a know nothing fan, have always believed in was the championship formula.
1. Whether its the Hawks with Gallinari, Bucks with Jrue, Clippers with Reggie Jackson, or the Suns with CP3, the impact of guys with 10 plus year careers in the league can often be felt in that even if they're bad, they provide some steadiness in the playoffs. Arguably these guys have bigger roles than they had, getting their big contracts, outside Reggie Jackson.

The Rockets bet the farm on PJ Tucker. Rockets didn't bet the farm on **PJ Tucker,** they had no choice. Rockets made the mistake of trading for Westbrook. Now, they were forced to be committed to the micro-ball route and traded for RoCo and trotted out a small ball lineup that featured PJ Tucker, (who ALSO was DISGRUNTLED already for not being given a contract extension and for playing through a pinched nerve at center while standing a buck 6'5,) at the 5. I never understood why they were convinced that the micro ball of relying on a lot of shooters that didn't well shoot at all was going to work... RoCo had a terrible shooting year at 31.5%, Eric Gordon shot 31.7%. You really need some positive production rather than mass inefficient volume 3 point shooting. Honestly, I think the Rockets made a mistake trading away Capela. I never understood why they were so quick to get rid of him, getting rid of your best rebounder, shot blocker, and under 26 locked up for next 3 years. But Westbrook/Harden killed their spacing and rendered Capela useless. \_\_\_ >Bam Adebayo helped sink the Celtics. Bam Adebayo was *a beast against the Celtics,* but we were also featuring Daniel Theis at 6'8, who's also a small ball center himself. The refs also seemed to love calling fouls on Theis, and we had terrible depth. Honestly, I'm not going to make excuses, but I think we had a better team on paper, but failed to execute. Credit to to Miami for doing their job. &#x200B; >Anthony Davis was a defensive force. Who still shouldn't be playing the 5, although that's his ideal position in the modern NBA. The problem is his inability to stay healthy plus being banged up against the bigger bulkier 5's is not a good plan for his health moving forward. That's why the Lakers have been intent in getting someone like a Drummond or Gasol to spell him at those minutes. >In 2021 though, arguably what we're seeing is the rise of Big ball centers -- guys with some offensive skills but whose role is really to play D and PLAY BIG. Three of the four teams left count on guys who are Big Ball centers -- Ayton, whose a mobile 7 footer and the talk of the playoffs, Lopez, a sweet shooting big man who can box out and defend well, and Clint Capela, whose as close to a poor man's clone of Dwight Howard as any in the league. This is a big difference than from last year. I'm defining the big ball center by what they do on D not O, btw. Yeah, but a lot of these bigs all benefit greatly from a team that has a solid PnR partner in Trae Young/CP3/Booker. I will say Lopez is different, because he has changed his shot profile to help space the floor. &#x200B; >Superstar/Hybrid Centers have done well this playoffs, but if you ask them to do too much on offense, you didn't get out of the second round There's a common trend in these superstar centers not making it out of the second round, and **that can be attributed to missing their 2nd options or lack of one,** (Simmons, Murray, Irving/Harden.) Irving/Harden were in and out, and Harris/Aaron Gordon/Tobias Harris all played below their expectations. Your role players and 2nd stars need to show up to win. There's just too many talented teams that have plenty of depth and pieces to make it a tough series.

Wouldn't be shocked if their injuries are worse than we think. Gobert can't solve the Jazz's weak perimeter defenders constantly giving up corner 3's, he defended pretty well. Terance Man just went ham, tip your hat off to him. When Gobert's forced to switch out and you're taking away and negating his shot blocking abilities, but you cannot also be happy with how passive at times, Gobert was whenever there was a smaller defender on him. Gobert is getting paid $40 million, he needs to learn maybe some basic post moves. Ayton, being switched on Morris would've been a field day for him. &#x200B; >The Suns are a young team but play like an old team, they don't turn the ball over that much and that will likely be a big reason they beat the Clippers, if they beat the Clippers. > >When I predicted the Lakers to go over the Suns in the first round, I was relying on old logic -- young teams don't win, even in wacky seasons.

I genuinely believe this is the net effect of CP3, he's one of those beyond the box score leader types. Young or old, it doesn't matter. They have the talent + experience. I think it's also a given at this point that players like Jae Crowder or CP3 help change the culture of the team. They are great leaders or role players that you can fit on any team. It's no coincidence that Crowder or Trevor Ariza's been such a journeymen. Plenty of teams value dogs.",3,0.098,0.765,0.137,0.9941,3.37
nbadiscussion,Camctrail,8 observations from this post-season.,2021-24-06 11:23:22 AM,"1. Big Ball vs Small Ball centers
1. One of things that was interesting was how in 2020, it was a season of small ball centers taking center stage. Bam Adebayo helped sink the Celtics. Anthony Davis was a defensive force. The Rockets bet the farm on PJ Tucker. All these dudes, outside Davis, were legit small for the center, while Davis is skinny. All of them had some level of success.
2. In 2021 though, arguably what we're seeing is the rise of Big ball centers -- guys with some offensive skills but whose role is really to play D and PLAY BIG. Three of the four teams left count on guys who are Big Ball centers -- Ayton, whose a mobile 7 footer and the talk of the playoffs, Lopez, a sweet shooting big man who can box out and defend well, and Clint Capela, whose as close to a poor man's clone of Dwight Howard as any in the league. This is a big difference than from last year. I'm defining the big ball center by what they do on D not O, btw. 2. Superstar/Hybrid Centers have done well this playoffs, but if you ask them to do too much on offense, you didn't get out of the second round
1. The common thread of KD, Embiid and Jokic. KD saw his teammates go down and him step up to play big and score, setting up the offense. He did amazing. It wasn't enough, eliminated. Embiid had to also be the last line of defense, play big and set up his offense. It was too much, eliminated. Jokic saw his teammates go down, play big and set up his offense. MVP of the regular season, but that's too much, eliminated. If you compare this to Giannis, whose job was to play D reasonably well while also leading the offense, but not be the entirety of the defense at the rim and doing defensive rebounding, you see why he's still standing. It's going to be a while before we see a Shaq in 2000 performance ever again, something that should make us appreciate that ALOT more. 3. Rudy Gobert took the heat for Utah losing, but the reality is is that injuries caught up to the team's guards. 1. We all just like to make fun of him and it's okay, he should gain a thicker skin. This one's been done ad nauseam. Just remember -- to lose a 26 point lead, both your defense and offense must fail, and considering Reggie Jackson and Terrance Mann suddenly went super saiyan, from all over the court, while Don Mitchell just couldn't score anymore, I put that lost squarely on the guards of the team, and then on Rudy. Wouldn't be shocked if their injuries are worse than we think.
4. The Suns are a young team but play like an old team, they don't turn the ball over that much and that will likely be a big reason they beat the Clippers, if they beat the Clippers.
1. When I predicted the Lakers to go over the Suns in the first round, I was relying on old logic -- young teams don't win, even in wacky seasons. Well, that's because young teams have a tendency to self combust, turning the ball over under pressure, not knowing who should shoot on the last play, having some chemistry issues, etc. That and the Lakers thrived off teams turning the ball over last season, turning Russell Westbrook's dribbling into a liability, something that led to transition and then AD putting the other team in foul trouble. Well... I was wrong! The Suns have legit none of those issues of young teams and are pretty careful with the basketball! One wonders if this due to CP3 being a basketball wizard and changing his approach with age and playing on that OKC team last season. I genuinely believe this is the net effect of CP3, he's one of those beyond the box score leader types. 5. Injuries had a big effect, but so do role players stepping up.
1. People will write about this 1000x here so I'm not going to add anything. Have at it.
6. Ben Simmons scraped by on potential and now that's simply not good enough.
1. 10 years ago, Ben Simmons would've played like Rajon Rondo, and would have been expected to have similar levels of success to Rondo. This legit wasn't that long ago, Rondo was phenomenal for a while and the league isn't fully in ""everyone must shoot"" mode until the Warriors first chip, though teams were experimenting. We still have players that are relics of that era, though increasingly, they're less effective. 2. As his season is now over, it's time to assess Ben Simmons and the role of ""non shooting, defense first point guards."" One surmises that a point guard who can't shoot, can't effectively do his job despite being 6'10, because the defense sags back in the playoffs. This isn't so much an issue if you're going to be running at the basket all the time in transition. The thing with playoff ball is that, transition opportunities get limited by teams suddenly playing much more carefully with the ball.
3. This then begs the question, are we simply miscasting Ben Simmons as a point guard now? Is he ACTUALLY a point guard or is he... a point forward or small ball 5? I think this is the major question surrounding Simmons, which is A) what is he and B) how much should he be enabled by teams (the Westbrook question). It doesn't take a genius to see he's probably needing a rethinking of what he can do by someone. 7. Trae Young, Kawhi Leonard, Luka Doncic, Kevin Durant, Donovan Mitchell, Devin Booker are keeping Kobe's memory alive even better than the 2020 Lakers did, by shooting from the midrange so effectively. 1. Arguably, this should be the least shocking thing about the playoffs -- when the clock ticks down and the balls in the superstars hands, their job is to make silly, ridiculous shots, like Kobe did, like Wade did, like Jordan did, etc. The midrange is the superstars shot, it's the shot they get paid for, and I just listed 6 guys who having that midrange in the game is probably lifting them past their peers. 8. The Hawks vs Bucks is a major question of winning in the NBA -- is defense or offense more important? 1. The Hawks are a better offensive team that is an okay defensive team. Capela helps. But you know, their best defense is shooting and making shots, kinda like the old Rockets were.
2. The Bucks are a staunch SLOW IT DOWN AND TRY TO SCORE ON US defensive team, with some shooters to keep the game close if the other team is scoring a lot or make the game get out of hand if the opponent can't score at all. They have four good defenders in the starting lineup, and in a way, somewhat resemble the 2020 Lakers, only Middleton is in the AD free safety role.
3. I don't know who would win, my prediction even after game 1 is this is a knockdown dragout series, but there's legit two philosophies on the floor, and if the Bucks win it would match my perception that BAD ASS D wins titles. But they also could not win. I don't know. 9. The teams left standing all have a combination of young guys and veterans, affirming what I, a know nothing fan, have always believed in was the championship formula.
1. Whether its the Hawks with Gallinari, Bucks with Jrue, Clippers with Reggie Jackson, or the Suns with CP3, the impact of guys with 10 plus year careers in the league can often be felt in that even if they're bad, they provide some steadiness in the playoffs.

For instance, there is a huge group of people that defend players like Westbrook, Giannis and Gobert despite the fact that they have come up short of expectations in the playoffs. Coaches such as Dwane Casey and Budenholzer were both very successful regular season coaches that came up short of expectations in the playoffs and have received almost unanimous disapproval because of their post season struggles. We can't forget that Bud was the coach of the year in 2015 and 2019 both years when he took different teams from mediocre eastern conference teams to 1st seeds. 

Just to be clear, I put A LOT of value in the playoffs. I love play off basketball, and the teams I route for I don't want to just have a great regular season followed by a 1st round exit. 

Does this have to do with the way fans relate to players vs. the way they relate to coaches?

If you get off to a horrific start, that’s enough to make a player or coach change. But if you roll along fine, have to deal with injuries, or stay at least competitive, it’s harder to judge off regular season. Playoffs are a much more accurate gauge. That’s the moment you get to see coaches under pressure. How do they make adjustments? How do they handle adversity? Can they get the most out of their best players in the big moments when it matters? Playoff results are much more telling for what a coach actually is. For example, guys like Mike Budenholzer and Doc Rivers have strange rotations that usually get picked apart. Coaches like Ty Lue are shown to be full of adjustments and making minutes count. Coaches like Spo and Pop find a way to get the most out of their players and run good systems when it matters. So unless the regular season is filled with locker room issues or bad starts, it’s much harder to gauge off of that compared to playoffs.",7,0.081,0.807,0.112,0.4098,6.12

nbadiscussion,Hurricanemasta,The obvious Ben Simmons trade,2021-24-06 2:27:48 PM,"With the recent [reports](https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2944958-report-nets-brass-was-upset-with-kyrie-irving-gm-would-listen-to-trade-offers) of the Nets front office possibly being open to discussing trading Kyrie Irving this offseason, I think the obvious deal is Ben Simmons for Kyrie - straight up. The salaries basically match up (Simmons actually makes a few million less than Kyrie), which is probably the major roadblock for most trade ideas for Ben Simmons. Moreover, this swap would give each team exactly what they want/need.
Nets: They address their greatest weakness - defense, with an All-Defensive first teamer. I am personally of the opinion that Ben Simmons should switch to center, or at least the frontcourt, where his defense will continue to have massive impact and his shooting woes will be minimized. Playing with two of the most talented scorers of the generation, if not ever, Simmons can stand in the dunker's spot all day and not ruin the offensive structure as Kevin Durant and James Harden do their damage from the midrange and long range, and he's there as a vertical spacer. Plus, maybe he can pick up some tips from Durant and Harden and evolve back into a useful offensive player with a more reliable free throw. All of this fails to mention that when Harden goes out, you replace him with an All-NBA player at point guard, and Ben Simmons durability shames Kyrie's.
Sixers: Shooting and iso offense - exactly what they need. With Kyrie's excellent marksmanship, Embiid can permanently park himself inside and finally eschew shooting 3's, something he's verbally stated he dislikes. When Embiid goes out, the Sixers will still be able to put points on the board with one of the league's best iso players and scorers. Is Kyrie a defensive downgrade? Sure, but the Sixers still have an All-Defense player in Matisse Thybulle - just give him a few more minutes (25-ish?) to paper over the deficit. Plus the offensive upgrade from Simmons to Kyrie should make it a net positive even with more time on the court for a weak offensive player like Thybulle.
And best of all, we the fans get two more complete championship contenders that boost the East further on to the level of the Western contenders. Everybody wins!",t3_o7aely,https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/o7aely/the_obvious_ben_simmons_trade/,4,22,t1_h2zunko,2021-25-06 6:55:49 AM,"I've been watching the NBA long enough to know that its history is littered with ""coulda woulda shoulda"", so for me, the idea that the Nets are so good when healthy that they should fairly easily cruise to a title next year if healthy simply doesn't hold water. Could the Sonics have won in '96 if they'd put Payton on Jordan earlier in the series? Would the Lakers have beaten the Pistons in '89 if Magic hadn't gotten injured? Should the '11 Heatles - with three Hall of Famers - have handled the Mavs with ease? Do I believe this trade is realistic? Of course not. Most of the trades discussed on reddit are not. Philly is going to struggle mightily finding any trading partner for Ben Simmons, and Kyrie has enough connections with the Nets to supersede any inclination Sean Marks may have to ""listen to offers"". My basic assertions are these - Kyrie fits wonderfully on the Sixers, Ben Simmons fits wonderfully on the Nets, both teams get demonstrably better, and the salaries match. If the GMs of these two teams were HurricaneMarks and DarrylMasta, I would pull the trigger on this so fast your head would spin. Personally, I believe that running it back is only a real strategy for a young team who lacks cohesion, and even then it's a strategy to get better, not win a title. NBA teams need to push the envelope every year just to keep up, and you don't have to look very far in the past to see instances where it paid off. Could the Raptors have simply run it back in '19 with their 59-win team? Would the Warriors have been just as well off keeping Harrison Barnes after a season in which they won 73? Should the '18 Nets continue to develop their young core in the hopes of climbing the Eastern ranks? After the 2012 finals, everyone thought the Thunder would be the next dynasty, and they they were destined for at least a handful of titles, but things happen. They ran it back again and again without making moves to become demonstrably better and they never sniffed the finals again. For my imagination, this is an interesting and plausible deal, and I'd tune in to the Sixers and Nets much more frequently than I do now because they'd both be more complete teams without redundant or deeply flawed for their system's players.

nbadiscussion,YelIowmamba,How do you use the postseason vs. the regular season to evaluate players or coaches?,2021-24-06 9:00:52 AM,"I've noticed a reasonable discrepancy in the way fans/commentators value players vs. the way they value coaches. For instance, there is a huge group of people that defend players like Westbrook, Giannis and Gobert despite the fact that they have come up short of expectations in the playoffs. Coaches such as Dwane Casey and Budenholzer were both very successful regular season coaches that came up short of expectations in the playoffs and have received almost unanimous disapproval because of their post season struggles. We can't forget that Bud was the coach of the year in 2015 and 2019 both years when he took different teams from mediocre eastern conference teams to 1st seeds. 

Just to be clear, I put A LOT of value in the playoffs. I love play off basketball, and the teams I route for I don't want to just have a great regular season followed by a 1st round exit. 

Does this have to do with the way fans relate to players vs. the way they relate to coaches?

They are both known for their playmaking and general offensive prowess (over their athleticism and defensive chops). They are both touted as the face of their respective franchises, now and in the upcoming seasons. You get the picture.

Difference is, one is on a team that is in the remaining four franchises still vying for a championship this season, while the other is in offseason mode. I'd just like to get your opinions on their situations. Could it be due to the players themselves? Is it the lack of a true co-star for Luka (KP vs Collins)? Is it the construction for the rest of the team? Is it coaching? Is it the FO or the rest of the organization? Or could it be something more external, like the odd predicament the league is in right now (injury-riddled, to say the least) or that the East is weaker than the West (or some combination of match-ups they had along the way)?

**Recent superstar trades:-**
***Harden (3 years left on his contract)-***
Caris LeVert, Kurucs, three first round draft picks (2022, 2024 and 2026) and four first round pick swaps (2021, 2023, 2025 and 2027) to Houston ***AD (1 year left on his contract)-***
Ingram, Lonzo, Hart, two first round picks (2019, 2022, 2024 or 2025) + pick swap (2023)
***Jrue Holiday (based on the trade package, 1 year left on his contract)***
Bledsoe, George Hill, three future first-round picks, and two additional Draft pick swaps. **Potential destinations:-** Sixers (Simmons, Maxey + Picks) Knicks (Picks) Nuggets (MPJ, Murray + Picks) Boston (Brown + Picks) Realistically, Dame can't contend in Portland and if he does actually want out as rumoured I think it's likely one of the four team that I've picked above and would involve a minimum of four 1st round picks. I don't think going to New York or Boston will make them an immediate title contender but Knicks will have the cap space and ability to sign another star. What's a good trade package?

nbadiscussion,DeModsCanSookMe,Kawhi to the Hawks in FA?,2021-27-06 4:14:10 PM,"If Kawhi decides to test the market in Free Agency this summer, I think the Hawks should definitely be on his radar. Here are some reasons why.
1. The Hawks don’t have to give up too much to get him. As it stands now, in order to clear enough cap space to give him the max (~$39.35 mil.), the Hawks would only have to renounce all their cap holds (including John Collins’), and dump the salaries of Gallo, Kris Dunn, and Bruno Fernando; sending those contracts and a 2nd-rounder or two to OKC probably does the job. That isn’t nothing — Gallo and John Collins are good players — but that doesn’t compare to Kawhi’s value, and the Hawks get to keep their young wings (Reddish, Huerter, and Hunter) and their 1st for this year.
2. The Hawks have the pieces to build a contender right now. As is, the Hawks’ core of Young, Hunter, Bogdanovic, Huerter, Capela, and Reddish are already pretty good, and have proven that the playoffs aren’t too big for them. Adding Leonard makes the Hawks true title contenders, and that’s before them rounding out their roster with vet Free Agents using their MLE and BAE. The Hawks could realistically field a lineup of
PG: Young
SG: Bogdanovic
SF: Hunter
PF: Leonard
C: Capela with a second unit of PG: Ish Smith
SG: Huerter
SF: Reddish
PF: Bobby Portis
C: Okongwu / Vet Min. Big
That team is deep, versatile, and well-rounded: a good mix for playoff basketball. Note also that Nate McMillan seems perfectly capable as a coach and should be the Hawks HC long-term, which is a plus.
3. The Hawks have the flexibility to trade for a disgruntled star next year, and that could truly make them special. Unlike most other teams contending for titles, the Hawks have good young players on cheap contracts for next year, and have all of their draft picks. If a star like Bradley Beal or Zach Lavine demands a trade, the Atlanta Hawks can outbid other teams in order to acquire them via trade. They could really sweeten the pot with multiple young players, numerous first round picks, and an established vet while still being a title contender worthy of a star player’s respect and time. That’s something that the Clippers and many other contenders can’t do, which makes them significantly less capable of improving their rosters substantially. This is what makes the Hawks uniquely good as a free agent landing spot. Adding a third star to Trae Young and Kawhi Leonard in 2022 would be entirely possible and would make the Hawks a true force in the NBA for years to come.
Ultimately, I don’t think this will happen at all, but the Hawks have a lot to offer for Kawhi and would be a good destination for him. What do y’all think?

As it stands now, in order to clear enough cap space to give him the max (~$39.35 mil.), the Hawks would only have to renounce all their cap holds (including John Collins’), and dump the salaries of Gallo, Kris Dunn, and Bruno Fernando; sending those contracts and a 2nd-rounder or two to OKC probably does the job. That isn’t nothing — Gallo and John Collins are good players — but that doesn’t compare to Kawhi’s value, and the Hawks get to keep their young wings (Reddish, Huerter, and Hunter) and their 1st for this year.
2. The Hawks have the pieces to build a contender right now. As is, the Hawks’ core of Young, Hunter, Bogdanovic, Huerter, Capela, and Reddish are already pretty good, and have proven that the playoffs aren’t too big for them. Adding Leonard makes the Hawks true title contenders, and that’s before them rounding out their roster with vet Free Agents using their MLE and BAE. The Hawks could realistically field a lineup of
PG: Young
SG: Bogdanovic
SF: Hunter
PF: Leonard
C: Capela with a second unit of PG: Ish Smith
SG: Huerter
SF: Reddish
PF: Bobby Portis
C: Okongwu / Vet Min. Big
That team is deep, versatile, and well-rounded: a good mix for playoff basketball. Note also that Nate McMillan seems perfectly capable as a coach and should be the Hawks HC long-term, which is a plus.
3. The Hawks have the flexibility to trade for a disgruntled star next year, and that could truly make them special. Unlike most other teams contending for titles, the Hawks have good young players on cheap contracts for next year, and have all of their draft picks. If a star like Bradley Beal or Zach Lavine demands a trade, the Atlanta Hawks can outbid other teams in order to acquire them via trade. They could really sweeten the pot with multiple young players, numerous first round picks, and an established vet while still being a title contender worthy of a star player’s respect and time. That’s something that the Clippers and many other contenders can’t do, which makes them significantly less capable of improving their rosters substantially. This is what makes the Hawks uniquely good as a free agent landing spot. Adding a third star to Trae Young and Kawhi Leonard in 2022 would be entirely possible and would make the Hawks a true force in the NBA for years to come.
Ultimately, I don’t think this will happen at all, but the Hawks have a lot to offer for Kawhi and would be a good destination for him. What do y’all think?

nbadiscussion,addictivesign,What is the future of the Clippers?,2021-27-06 11:05:25 PM,"They’re currently down 3-1 in the WCF to the Suns in a series where they’re more than likely to lose. They have an aging and injury prone Kawhi Leonard who has mysterious handlings of his injuries and doesn’t seem like much of a team leader. They have Paul George who has been better at times this postseason, but has also still come up short at times where the moment needs him to come through. It seems like another wasted year in the Paul George-Kawhi Leonard era. 

A few things going for them: Terance Mann is developing into a fine-caliber role player. Reggie Jackson is playing some of his best basketball ever. Tyronn Lue is proving to be an upgrade at head coach over Doc Rivers. They seem to be a more resilient team than we’re used to. 

But they’re a team capped out and low on realistic flexibility going forward. Kawhi and Ibaka have POs. Jackson and Batum are UFAs this offseason. Most of their best draft capital was given to OKC in the PG trade. Teams such as the Lakers, Warriors, and Nuggets should be healthier in the West next season and will make the Clips path harder. 

I just don’t know what this team looks like in the future. They’re coming up short in their present iteration, and have aging superstars along with tough competition, but also have made some positive steps this season. What should they do going forward? How much longer do you keep the Kawhi-PG duo together?

I know refs don’t always call all violations-traveling and 3 second rules come to mind. But watching refs hold the ball, ready to go, until Giannis finishes his pantomime free throw practice, and then almost never calling a violation when his shots go over 10 seconds is astonishing to me. I don’t watch every game, so maybe they have cut others this same slack, but I haven’t seen anything like it in any game I’ve watched this year. In that sense, the failure of the refs to follow the rule is uniquely benefiting a single team, and is therefore not the same as the laxity in the rules listed above, where they don’t strictly apply the rule even as most teams show violations. That’s a random following of the rule; this allowance for Giannis is a specific act that is repeated multiple times a game. It also seems like the ref standing and waiting for Giannis to be ready, while everyone else on the court is ready and waiting, constitutes a delay of game. A player or coach would certainly get dinged for that kind of delay, wouldn’t they? Even a recent nba last 2 minute report listed two 10 sec violations as Incorrect NonCalls. How are the referees allowed to continue exhibiting such bias in favor of only one team in their refusal to follow this rule for this single player? I’ve seen arguments that they won’t change now because they set precedent throughout the season-that would work if this happened across the board to most teams, but it doesn’t. It is a delay of game, committed willfully and repeatedly by refs, to the benefit of a single player and a single team. What is the rationale for refs causing a delay of game and exhibiting clear bias with their refusal to enforce this rule?",1,0.099,0.798,0.103,-0.2127,2.53
nbadiscussion,TheSmilingDentist,Shouldn't the Sixers trade Embiid instead of Simmons?,2021-28-06 10:30:43 AM,"Okay, 

Controversial take: Joel Embiid is spectacular, a two way phenom, the reason the Sixers are good recently, and simply a player with an MVP type of ceiling. 

But with his injury history, are we sure the Sixers are making the right decision keeping him above Simmons?

Now no one could predict injuries, Embiid is still young, and a center of his caliber is literally impossible to find... 

But isn't that the point? Embiid would fetch a crazy high amount of picks and players if he was traded today, similar to the AD and Jrue Holiday and Paul George trades. Meanwhile, I imagine, Simmons wouldn't. 

So if you did trade Embiid -- who would you get back? Could you trade him for all of New York's assets and picks? or to Oklahoma for a good amount of their draft war chest? Would a team of Ben Simmons + high pick X + new young guy you traded for + Tyrese Maxey, who you assume wouldn't get traded + Tobias Harris eventually be better than what you could build around Embiid? Is Embiid so good that he's worth more risk? 

Meanwhile -- what do you get for Simmons exactly? Are you sure you're getting back a guy who helps you win now? Is that guy the short term answer for a finals appearance? And what if Simmons just improves immediately with a new team and coach?

So I'm just saying, maybe the Sixers should sell high on Embiid and do the quick retool around Simmons instead.",t3_o9p4iw,https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/o9p4iw/shouldnt_the_sixers_trade_embiid_instead_of/,0,9,t1_h3cdx7x,2021-28-06 10:41:51 AM,"> eanwhile -- what do you get for Simmons exactly?

nbadiscussion,Persianx6,How might Shaq's career after 2005 have been different if he had stayed fit and played more?,2021-28-06 2:06:56 AM,"**Shaq's career stats (that I will be using for the purposes of this post):**

From the 1993 to 2005 Season, Shaq averaged 67 games per Season. **For the first scenario I will do the following:**

1. In the final six Seasons of his career, I’m going to continue to use 67 games each year.
2. Instead of using his points per game as they were, I’m instead going to take a different approach, and decrease his ppg by 1.5ppg each successive Season.

**Scenario One:**

&#x200B;

**Now I’m going to assume Shaq:**

1. Ends up playing 20 Seasons instead of 19.
2. Plays 70 games per Season for his remaining seven Seasons (after 2005).
3. Decreased his ppg by 1ppg each year instead of 1.5.

Controversial take: Joel Embiid is spectacular, a two way phenom, the reason the Sixers are good recently, and simply a player with an MVP type of ceiling. 

But with his injury history, are we sure the Sixers are making the right decision keeping him above Simmons?

Now no one could predict injuries, Embiid is still young, and a center of his caliber is literally impossible to find... 

But isn't that the point? Embiid would fetch a crazy high amount of picks and players if he was traded today, similar to the AD and Jrue Holiday and Paul George trades. Meanwhile, I imagine, Simmons wouldn't. 

So if you did trade Embiid -- who would you get back? Could you trade him for all of New York's assets and picks? or to Oklahoma for a good amount of their draft war chest? Would a team of Ben Simmons + high pick X + new young guy you traded for + Tyrese Maxey, who you assume wouldn't get traded + Tobias Harris eventually be better than what you could build around Embiid? Is Embiid so good that he's worth more risk? 

Meanwhile -- what do you get for Simmons exactly? Are you sure you're getting back a guy who helps you win now? Is that guy the short term answer for a finals appearance? And what if Simmons just improves immediately with a new team and coach?

I think the energy they bring to the table without putting up skull crushing eye popping box score stats has been really fun to watch.

I have also really enjoyed seeing some inexperienced young dudes go out there and hoop their asses off in the playoffs- Trae Young, John Collins and D Book come to mind.

I think overall though I personally have most enjoyed watching Paul George play this postseason. I love his impact on the court and watching his sort of “redemption” playoff run has added an emotional component I very much appreciate. Their have been some other big performances by other role players and George sometimes shoots like shit but his composure and ability to smooth the game out is why this Clippers team was able to come back against the Mavs, Jazz and maybe the Suns. Every game has been pretty close, within reach.

This has been a really diverse postseason and I am very interested to hear who you have enjoyed watching play the most.",t3_o9nsuy,https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/o9nsuy/who_has_been_your_favorite_player_to_watch_this/,6,11,t1_h3c7fjx,2021-28-06 9:54:37 AM,"Lord Dario.

Ayton has proved that he can dominate the paint against ACTUAL centers and he has shown flashes this series too (4/5 in the 1Q with 11 points in Game 3).

I noticed a few possessions though where Ayton just didn’t seem that interested in getting the ball. He drifts into the paint, behind his defender, and sort of half throws his hands up whilst thinking about the potential rebound. It would be really great to see him sealing his man, screaming for the ball and showing some intent to score down low. I think this was also exacerbated by Paul and Booker both hunting iso jumpers this game without involving the rest of the team. I also thought Paul was unusually indecisive in the first half and didn’t do enough to get the team in rhythm. By the time Ayton started getting a couple more touches in the 4th, it struck me he was out of sorts and not in the flow of the game. Getting Ayton involved and engaged early should be a priority next game.",18,0.074,0.844,0.082,0.34,2.32

nbadiscussion,philabuster34,The playoffs this year is a testament to James Harden’s legacy.,2021-24-06 6:15:22 AM,"First off, I am a huge James fan and if anyone wants to slander him and come down to Houston and throw fists please let me know.

Secondly my analysis comes from everything James wanted in Houston vs what he could have had.

1. Chris Paul. CP3 and Harden were a great tandem till their personal relationship broke down. James wanted him out and Morey pulled the trigger and sent him to OKC. Now CP3 is leading the young suns into the WCF.

2. Clint Capela. This guy was an elite rebounder for James and he opened up his offense. If James missed a shot Clint was there to keep the offense going. Clint had to be moved since him and Russ clogged the court for James. Now Clint is helping the Hawks in the ECF with another free shooter in Ice Trae.

3. PJ Tucker. James always didn’t like how he didn’t have superstar talent next to him but PJ is a horse. One of the hardest working players in the league and a 3 point shooter. Now he’s in the ECF with the Bucks.

4. Mike D’Antoni. James loved MDA since he turned him from a good scorer to an elite one. MDA coddled him and the team into believing they could sacrifice easy 2 for 3 point shots. Harden followed him to Brooklyn and now they are watching from home. 

5. Daryl Morey. Another guy who coddled James. DM was never afraid to make a risky move that helped James win a title. When he left James wanted out. Now DM is stuck with Ben Simmons trying to prove he can win with Morey ball.

6. Brooklyn Nets. James finally gets his super team but he joins an often injured KD and Kyrie. It ends up not working this season due to his and Kyries injury.

7. Rafael Stone. James didn’t want to give Stone a chance in building a team around him. Stone could have offloaded Russ to the Knicks for expiring contracts to start the rebuild but he went for John Wall to give Harden a chance to consider staying here. Stone got ridiculed for not trading James for Ben Simmons but now it looks like it worked out for the Rockets as they aren’t stuck with Ben and we have the #2 pick.

8. Stephen Silas. This is a coach who James wouldn’t give a chance to. Didn’t show up to training camp. Turns out the players love him and even ex players like Luka Doncic are a starting to realize how important he was.

9. Christian Wood. A player that James really needed. A pick and pop big that he could have used in the playoffs that he didn’t want to give a chance to.

I’m not saying if James stayed we win a title this year. I’m just saying all the reasons he wanted out are starting to hurt his legacy.",t3_o70n95,https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/o70n95/the_playoffs_this_year_is_a_testament_to_james/,2,1,t1_h3i922y,2021-29-06 5:51:28 PM,What a run though!

nbadiscussion,skiddster3,Why aren’t the Suns feeding Ayton?,2021-28-06 9:46:35 PM,I really do not understand why the Suns play the Clippers small ball game when there is literally not a center on the floor for the Clippers. Ayton has proved that he can dominate the paint against ACTUAL centers and he has shown flashes this series too (4/5 in the 1Q with 11 points in Game 3). Not a Suns fan so not sure if there is an underlying rotation issue that is going on or what but it’s infuriating seeing Ayton just stand there towering over Batum doing nothing.,t3_oa18pw,https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/oa18pw/why_arent_the_suns_feeding_ayton/,623,109,t1_h3fnnbz,2021-29-06 5:59:51 AM,"This is kind of like asking why isn't MJ shooting 3s? That just isn't how the Suns/Ayton plays basketball. The Sun's strength, the way they play the game, and the reason why they're so good, comes from their elite passing. They abuse poor defensive positioning and this is how they managed to dominate the regular season. This is also why they shoot so many mid range jumpers as teams will generally guard the key/3pt rather than mid. The reason why Ayton wasn't getting the ball as much was due to the nature of having a smaller man on you. Sure Batum/PG can't bully Ayton, but being smaller, they can reposition/follow a lot quicker giving Booker/CP a smaller window to pass to Ayton. So why don't they just feed Ayton? Because it goes against everything the Suns have built, their entire bball philosophy. Exploit defensive positioning/prioritizing only good high value shots. Going back-to-basket, bully basketball is known for being inefficient. Not only that, but Ayton just is 'not that guy'. And even if he did go iso, I don't see how Ty Lue wouldn't just put Cousins in to negate that action.",14,0.078,0.801,0.121,0.7246,2.71

nbadiscussion,[deleted],These playoffs are really showing some other strengths besides player talent,2021-29-06 10:13:34 PM,"Let me preface this by saying that it does suck that all these stars are/have gone down and not played playoff games.
philosophically I've always felt that the 7 game series format for so many rounds, is built to make sure the best teams win. I think it breaks down in to 3 main parts of a team that are shown in the playoffs. 1) the skill level, clutchness, talent of your major stars. I think this is what most of the viewers are watching for most years. guys who can make shots towards the end of games, guys who can dominate, score, rebound, make highlights, get everyone pumped. Guys like Dame, Luca, etc dominate in these fields. But you can't do it alone in this space. just look at some of the most talented teams in history not winning a chip. For me, the greatest examples are teams like the Lakers with malone and payton. The first year heatles. which brings us to:
2) coaching. which is so much easier to see when it's deficient than when it is working super well. Coaching makes your team work together. Coaching is shown in how well your team is prepped, how you manage the game, call time outs, make adjustments during a game and between games. How you motivate your players. When it's deficient, you get things like Doc Rivers losing 3-1 series leads for not making adjustments. But you need something beyond just super talented players, and great coaching. You need:
3) a really good talented strong front office (and maybe owner with money or who understands their role). I think this year more than any, the front office work is really showing. With stars going down left and right, a lot of moves the front office made for depth is shining through. The clippers? let go of montrez harrell, lou williams. But kept reggie jackson? drafted Terrance Mann? Maybe the rondo move didn't work. but cousins has been working out. Morris? Their depth is working wonders in a bunch of games where Kawhi isn't on the floor, and neither is Ibaka. Compare this to the Lakers, who this year brought in Montrez Harrell, Schroder, Drummond. All seemed like amazing pick ups, but when their stars were hurt, it didn't seem to work. The most telling was when there was 6 min left in the play in game with the warriors, and none of their big pickups were on the floor. It was still Caruso, Kuz, KCP types on the floor. although i think THT seems to be working out. But the Hawks sans Trae dominating a game? have to give some credit to the guys who assembled that team. Suns winning two WCF games without Chris Paul? Mavs couldn't win one with injured Luka. Jazz wimming games without conley. Denver winning games without murray. It's always been important for teams to have good pieces, especially championship teams with great role player pieces. Insanely important role players like Robery horry, horace grant types. Modern day 3 and D guys. Iggy, barnes, mario chalmers? FVV exploding. I've pondered if Dallas should have kept Seth Curry. He did so well for philly. Did they miss him? More than anything, this year, is exposing the skill set of the front offices. Championships have been won or lost in moves made years ago. Draft picks taken years in advance. But most of the time the stars are sucking up all the energy. But the truth is, you need a good front office to win a chip. someone to make a ballsy gamble, trading demar for kawhi. picking up cp3 to pair with your harden. (ok they didn't win a chip but they got hella hella close). It's so fascinating watching some of these teams succeed. It's not like Trae is more talented or amazing than luka. But one team is farther, and i do think the front office has a big thing to do with this. Steve Ballmer, bringing in Jerry West, firing Doc, hiring Ty Lue. contributes to breaking the curse? For sure right? then watching Doc tank the sixers. I think this postseason is really telling when it comes to things like, is Polinka a top tier GM or is it about Lebron and AD. How are these franchises doing: Blazers, Celtics, Nuggets. Vs the Suns and the Hawks. How good are teams drafting and developing and coaching. This postseason, more than any, has been showing and exposing some of the talent and skills on the GM/front office positions.",t3_oaq941,https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/oaq941/these_playoffs_are_really_showing_some_other/,118,31,t1_h3kss6e,2021-30-06 9:34:46 AM,[deleted],2,0,1,0,0,1.5

That season, Philly moves the pick along with Landry shamet for Tobias Harris. Now, here’s where it gets weird. Miami wanted to sign Jimmy butler, but needed to find a buyer for Hassan Whiteside’s contract. In exchange for helping the transaction go through(and lowering the trade value of the Miami pick), the clippers got moe harkless and an additional future Miami first in 2023. The clipppers than traded the Miami picks, a lot of their own draft capital, and SGA in exchange for Paul George.

(Copied from a previous post) 2020’s Dame Lilard. What he’s done in Portland is amazing. He does more with less help than anyone. He singlehandedly drags them into the playoffs and beats better teams with shots like this. https://youtu.be/a-M3x-eZpV8 2010’s Derrick Rose. Youngest MVP of all time. An unseen combination of quickness, speed and strength. His ability to finish around the rim was amazing. https://youtu.be/ikc-uM_Ekkc 2000’s Ray Allen. Arguably one of the greatest three point shooters of all time, if not the greatest. Led the Celtics to a title. Also turned in a criminally underrated performance as Jesus Shuttlesworth in “He Got Game.” And for those who thought he was just a shooter, here’s footage of him dunking on one of the greatest shot blockers of all time. https://youtu.be/Tdy7yO_tGCA 1990’s Chris Webber. The power forward who was way ahead of his time. He could shoot from outside, handle, and finish. He had an incredibly high basketball IQ and could pick apart defenses with his mind before they even knew what they were doing as evidenced below. https://youtu.be/o7ChxCkVSis 1980’s Julius Erving. You know he’s the best when he gets name checked in a Run DMC song. He was the games greatest dunker and the star that brought the NBA back from the brink. Why was he such a great star? The dimensions of the court didn’t apply to him, neither did gravity. https://youtu.be/abBAyjATTHY 1970’s Spencer Haywood. You know why NBA players don’t have to go through four years of college, providing free labor for schools that make millions off their back? Because Spencer Haywood took them to court and won the right to enter the draft early. And he deserved to get in the game early because he was better than everyone else from his era with his thunderous dunks and ability to finish with either hand. His jump shot was sweet too. https://youtu.be/y0UAzzLksww 1960’s Jerry Sloan. He was arguably the greatest defender of all time. He was hard nosed, scrappy, and relentless on his way to six All NBA first or second team selections. https://youtu.be/2NTQGqX9q_s 1950’s Dolph Schayes. Obviously he suffers from the unfortunate bias of sharing a first name with Adolf Hitler. But don’t let that fool you. He was the games original innovator of positionless basketball. He was a forward that was tall for his era, but could kill you with his outside shot. If anyone doubts how smart of a player he was, just look at his aeronautical engineering degree. How else would you explain career averages of 18 points, 12 rebounds and 3 assists per game? https://youtu.be/EL2s7i86rog",1,0.055,0.826,0.119,0.9723,2.69

nba,iAMtHESushighost,Has a player ever embodied his team’s name more than Giannis embodies a buck?,2021-11-07 5:09:06 PM,"When Milwaukee was awarded an NBA team in 1968 the city held a fan contest to name the new team. The name ""Bucks"" was chosen because “bucks are spirited, good jumpers, fast and agile”. Almost 45 years later Giannis enters the league doing his best impression of a buck – he’s definitely spirited, he can jump out the gym, and doing so all while being fast and agile.

So has a player eclipsed Giannis as the perfect embodiment of his team’s name? Let’s find out.

\*Disclaimer – some teams’ names are too abstract or “wild” to embody (how does one embody a thunder? And what the \*\*\*\* is a clipper?) so I had to bend the rules a little bit. Also, as a so-called “nephew”, I tried to choose only players who played in the last 30ish years.

nba,Chachimichonga,I hate how easily teams blame/fire coaches,2021-11-07 7:48:25 AM,"This year I've seen articles about almost every team thinking of firing their head coach. It makes no sense whatsoever. People seem to either have incredibly high expectations or think that hiring someone new will instantly fix all of the team's problems, even the ones that had nothing to do with coaching in the first place.

An example of this is Doc Rivers. Granted, he hasn't been perfect. But when it comes to this year's playoffs there were a lot of issues he couldn't do anything about. Joel's injury wasn't his fault. The fact that the 76ers have like 4 guys who play the same position and no real point guard wasn't his fault. Ben Simmons' awful playoffs performance wasn't his fault. I don't think Doc deserves the insane amount of hate he's been getting since their elimination or that he should automatically be fired because of it. It's funny how no one was complaining about him during the regular season when the 76ers were the number 1 seed. 

Another name that comes to mind is Mike Budenholzer. The Bucks were thinking about firing him last year after their loss to the Heat. They kept considering it throughout these playoffs as well, saying they'd probably replace him if the Bucks lost to the Nets. THE FRICKING NETS. The insanely loaded superstar team that everyone thought would sweep their way to the finals. It just doesn't seem fair. And I'm pretty sure we'll still be hearing those rumors if the Bucks don't end up winning the championship - despite the fact that Budenholzer got them to the finals for the first time since 1974.

And the list goes on. This ""get us a ring asap or your value as a coach will constantly be threatened and questioned"" mentality is ridiculous and I think it's actually hurting teams more than helping them.",t3_oi5s4i,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/oi5s4i/i_hate_how_easily_teams_blamefire_coaches/,0,46,t1_h4tca7v,2021-11-07 8:10:11 AM,"Lol the Bud apologist revisionist history.

CollegeBasketball,Armadillo_Dildo,"Interactive ""Power Projection"" Map",2021-09-07 9:27:11 AM,"I love checking up on the imperialism maps / the ""remaining undefeated teams"" maps throughout the season, so I've been working on my own version for the coming 2021-22 season: the [CBB ""Power Projection"" Map](https://imgur.com/urkj2Pg) (currently using the latest data from the end of the 2021 season).

In this map, each US county is assigned an ""owner"" based on who has the highest power projection score in that county. This score is calculated for each team in each county by taking their Kenpom Adj. EM and dividing it by the distance between the team's stadium and the nearest county border -- the result is that each county is controlled by the strongest nearby team, allowing teams to expand and protect their ""domain"" by playing better (and thus raising their Adj. EM throughout the season). In order to avoid making it too cluttered, I also imposed a rule that only the top 30 teams (by Adj. EM) could own land; this is pretty arbitrary though so if you think it should be different let me know. 

You can explore the map (and see which non-landed teams are within each team's domain) using this interactive version I made:

> https://werdna63.shinyapps.io/ncaa-maps/#section-power-projection-map

(It should work on mobile, but it's probably going to look a lot better on a desktop / laptop)

It also includes a data viewing tool that lets you view the total land area, water area, population, etc. of each team's ""domain"" (you can even export the tables to a .CSV or a .PDF!). It should update automatically after each game since it draws the data directly from Kenpom.com too!

I'm posting this here now because I wanted to see if anyone had any feedback / recommendations for how I could improve this before the season starts; I also might throw something similar together for college football since that's coming up even sooner. If this is something you think would be fun / if you have any feedback it would be appreciated!",t3_ogz54c,https://www.reddit.com/r/CollegeBasketball/comments/ogz54c/interactive_power_projection_map/,50,30,t1_h4m4mvg,2021-09-07 10:43:52 AM,I'm not sure about UVa owning eastern NC ..

CollegeBasketball,10_Tree,"Parity Comparison: Premier League vs. Hypothetical Top Division College Basketball Teams, 2003-04 Through 2021-22",2021-09-07 3:41:41 PM,"Implementing a promotion/relegation system for college basketball is a terrible idea. Using recent statistics to retrodict what would have happened if a major, fundamental change had occurred in the past is lazy, misleading, and often uninformative. So, naturally, I wanted to find out what the (Division I Men's) college basketball landscape might look like if it had a promotion/relegation system exactly the same as the English Football Pyramid.
&#x200B;
The English pyramid scheme promises 7,000+ teams that they could win the national title in within 11 years or so if they just do well enough, but the champion winds up being the same 5 or 6 teams all the time. I figure college basketball has got to be more volatile than that, right? So this could be interesting?
&#x200B;
I used the Massey College Basketball Ranking Composite from the final week of each year to retrodict how well each team would do compared to the other teams in their league, with teams then promoted/relegated according to the current rules of the English pyramid scheme, with the exception that we only need 8 levels instead of 11 to cover all of the Division I Men's Basketball teams. For college hoops, Massey only goes back to the 2002-03 season, so I used that year to determine which of the 15 leagues in the 8 different levels each team gets to start, and I'm only retrodicting starting with the 2003-04 season. This is clearly the best time period to use, the best ranking to use, the best promotion/relegation system to use, and the best way to determine the starting position for each team, and anyone who disagrees with me isn't worth arguing against, because they have no grasp of written sarcasm.
&#x200B;
Using this method, the actual, real-life champion of the NCAA Tournament each year would have been competing in the top league every year except for the infamously wild 2011 tournament, when UConn would have been in the second-best league. OK, that's not 100% true - UNC got a rough starting spot in the third level in 2003-04 and didn't have enough time to make it to the top league for their tourney win the next year, but that's a weird artifact of how I chose the starting positions and not a reflection on the parity of college basketball. When everything settled down, it seemed that only maybe 20 teams out of 350+ are realistically capable of winning the tourney in any given year, or maybe 25 in really wild years without strong top teams. Less than 10% of the teams competing. Doesn't seem great... until you compare it with the English football.
&#x200B;
51 basketball teams would spend time in the top level of our fantasy realm, with 12 of them winning the top league at some point in the 18 year period. The actual Premier League featured only 41 teams over the same time period, with only 6 of them winning the league, including the once-in-a-generation accomplishment of underdogs Leicester City. So college basketball tends to have more teams in with a chance at a championship any given year and to rotate those teams out from year-to-year more often than English football. I show a comparison below, with teams currently in the top league going into 2021-22 highlighted in green. And if you look across the row, you might find a soccer team that can torture you in the same way as your basketball team! Isn't cross-cultural misery wonderful?
&#x200B;

Of course, there is another way to compare parity between these two sports. In England, only the top 90ish teams are fully professional. So, instead of comparing the 350 Division I teams giving out scholarships to all 7,000+ soccer teams in England, maybe it's more fair to compare them to just the professional teams? In England, 6 of the top 92 teams have a realistic shot at the title. That's 6.5%, and 6.5% of 350 teams is about 23 teams... so do we actually have as much parity, within the whole of Division I, as English football? Do we just think we have more parity because we have more teams, and never think about any team (other than our own) outside the top 100? Something to think about.
&#x200B;
But with more teams in general, and still only one champion, there is more mystery and intrigue about who will be champion in any given year. And it's more exciting to have a tournament that any team could qualify for, where teams without title hopes could still pull off the upset of the century that they can remember more fondly than the top teams recall a championship a decade ago! We can ignore that England also does this exact same thing in their Cup competitions and put off consideration of the extent to which innately unevenly distributed resources translates into sporting success independent of sport or tactics for another day, since this post is already long enough.

It just makes sense In a lot of ways it didn't come from the NBA instead the other way around. The vast majority of basketball isn't played in the NBA, so it makes sense that a lot of the innovation ends up happening elsewhere. Nick Nurse and Mike D'Antoni came up with their unusual styles in Europe, a lot of pace and space started in low level college programmes, and the women's game has been hoisting a lot of 3s in recent years As for some of those other things, it depends more. In college it's less likely that you have multiple athletic wings, so switching is harder, and it's harder to find a big with NBA size and ability so often if you have one they will be featured more prominently. Simply because there's a strong chance that the other team doesn't have a player like that In the women's game, size is a bigger advantage than in the men's game. Due to the decreased physical athleticism and speed, it's simply harder to make up for size. A lot more of the game is played through the post, and while many of the women's games best players are guards, it's comparatively harder for them to attack bigs and the offensive shift to perimeter creation has been less drastic The international game is mixed. They often play more through their bigs, partially due to the same reasons above of not having the same athletes on the perimeter, fewer high quality bigs with size, and more physicality on the perimeter. But international play has also long been ahead of the NBA, spread pick and roll was the normal overseas long before the NBA. They often play with a smaller more athletic 5, or a skilled 5 simply because that's what was available and that's what a lot of overseas leagues create",32,0.036,0.875,0.089,0.9418,5.89

nba,Icy_Elephant_6370,[Serious] Does a Ben Simmons to MN trade even make sense without a third team?,2021-12-07 10:51:30 AM,"TL:DR: assuming KAT/Ant/DLo are untouchable (for reasons explained below), the Wolves realistically lack a package the Sixers, who are trying to win now, would want. On this line of thinking, a third team is necessary to send a star player to the Sixers and receive assets from the Wolves for Simmons. But finding a third team that is willing to give up a star player and accept long-term assets is also difficult. I don’t have an answer, just discussing/brainstorming. The Simmons to MN chatter started almost immediately following the Sixers’ exit from the playoffs. With confirmation from Wolves beat writers that they will intensely pursue Simmons, and the two teams discussing a trade (albeit, not yet substantively), the discussion seems to be gaining momentum. He would undeniably be a great fit on the Wolves. His elite defense/defensive versatility, playmaking, and rebounding would significantly help raise the floor of a Twolves team that lacks all three. All else equal, a starting 5 of DLo-Ant-McDaniels-Simmons-KAT could be a very real playoff team. And a KAT/Simmons pairing would complement each other almost perfectly. The big question is what it takes to get him and finding a mutually beneficial trade. While his value is at an all-time low, he’s still a 24 year old 3x all-star, 2x first-team defender and DPOY runner up. While his shooting woes are undeniable, his skill otherwise is similarly undeniable. Any realistic trade scenario for Simmons would be expensive. There’s no world where some combo of Culver/Rubio/firsts (or whatever other bullshit low-ball ideas people like to come up with) would work. So what does a trade for Simmons look like? Thinking about the Sixers’ current situation: Embiid is 27, injury-prone, and playing at an MVP level. He’s in his prime, but with his injury history, there’s no way to know how long that prime lasts. The Sixers want to win now. If they were to trade Simmons, it wouldn’t make sense for them to accept a package centered around future assets. What they need is an established offensive star that they can pair with Embiid and get immediate returns. Given their current situation, I just don’t see what the Wolves have to offer that would entice the Sixers in a two-team trade. Let’s consider the Timberwolves’ current assets:
- KAT- Untouchable, probably not even worth including in the discussion. - DLo- DLo is an intriguing option. While he’s not a good defender and not particularly athletic, he is solid playmaker, good 3 point shooter, and can create his own shot at all three levels. He would slot in well next to Embiid as a second option on offense who can space the floor. But I don’t see this one happening. Simmons is more valuable than DLo, and I’m not sure DLo is enough to move the needle for the Sixers. Moreover, the Timberwolves seem particularly disinclined to trade him, viewing him as a core piece of the Wolves and going to great lengths to acquire him in the first place. - Ant- The discussion on Ant is a bit more nuanced. Yes, he has a ton of value, but I also think the Wolves and Sixers probably view his value differently. Simmons is currently way more valuable than Ant, I am not trying to argue otherwise. But if you look at the Timberwolves’ current needs, and Ant’s potential, he’s probably viewed as untouchable in the context of a Simmons trade. He’s a big, athletic wing with a great handle who can create his own shot. That’s the archetype every NBA team is looking for right now. 2-3 years from now, I think there’s a non-zero chance Ant is better than Simmons currently is, and given how bad the Wolves are, I think they almost have to gamble that Ant does develop that way. I also think the Sixers probably view Ant as having less value, compared to the Wolves’ perception of him. They are looking for an impact player/star right now. A 19 year old with 30 games of good NBA basketball under his belt doesn’t really fit that mold, and it would be a huge gamble on the Sixers’ part to do an Edwards-centered trade if what they’re looking for is a player who can slot in and have a big impact next year. - Malik Beasley. One of the few not “untouchable” positive assets the Wolves have. He doesn’t have a good handle and cant reliably create his own shot, but he’s a high-energy player and an absolute flamethrower from 3. But he’s more of a roleplayer than a guy you can look to help carry an offense, which it seems is what the Sixers need. For that reason, I don’t think Beasley really moves the needle for the Sixers either. - Jaden McDaniels. Already an elite defender with a reliable 3-pt shot (36% from 3 his rookie year). In addition to his defensive prowess, he’s also flashed some upside on offense with a nice handle and the ability to (unreliably) create his own shot. A highly valuable asset, but again, I don’t think he does much for the Sixers in the context of a Simmons trade, considering the fact that they’re likely looking for a star. He could be a nice add-in to a larger package, but that’s about it.
- Naz Reid. Second year backup center on an absurdly team-friendly deal. Excellent scorer, capable defender, although somewhat undersized. Think Trez Harrell-lite with a 3 pt shot. Again, he could be a nice add-in in a larger package, but he doesn’t move the needle for the Sixers. - Ricky Rubio. Veteran PG with playoff experience on an expiring contract. Smart, excellent playmaker, solid defender, although his athleticism inhibits him on that end. Not sure why the Sixers would have interest though, given his lack of scoring prowess. That’s kind of the list of positive assets the Timberwolves have. Could they cobble together some combo of DLo/Beasley/McDaniels/Reid and future firsts to put together an acceptable offer? Maybe, but other teams would be able to easily beat that offer. Moreover, for the Sixers, it would be like trading a dollar for four quarters. Why give up an all-star and elite defender for a handful of players that, summed up, might not even be as valuable as Simmons is?
So then, my thinking goes to three team trades: MN sending assets to a third team, the Sixers sending Simmons to MN (and potentially assets to the third team), the third team trading their star to Philly. I don’t think there are a ton of viable options, because you need a team that has a star-level player that is willing to trade that player, and is also willing to take on future assets as compensation, i.e. get worse in the short-term. Maybe it’s Dame or CJ. Maybe it’s Beal. Maybe it’s a Lowry sign and trade, I really have no idea. But at that rate, why wouldn’t the Sixers just send Simmons + assets to a team that actually has a star they want? A scenario including MN and a third team where the third team gives up a star and MN gets Simmons completely waters down the value of the third team being involved in the first place. To me, it just doesn’t seem like there’s even a remotely realistic way for the Twolves to get Simmons. The Wolves clearly want Simmons, and Simmons would clearly be a great fit. But it doesn’t seem like MN has players they would be willing to trade that the Sixers would also have interest in, and involving a third team obviates the need for MN to be involved in the first place.",t3_oiwi3m,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/oiwi3m/serious_does_a_ben_simmons_to_mn_trade_even_make/,16,49,t1_h4y5q28,2021-12-07 11:26:00 AM,"The prospect of Simmons, Towns and Edwards does sound pretty amazing if I’m being honest.

nba,KingOfKetchup,Is it now safe to say Lebron isn’t a top 5 player,2021-12-07 4:26:59 AM,"Now before I list my consensus top 5, remember that this NOW. I’m a neutral fan and appreciate Lebron as a player. I even believe he’s at least the 2nd best player already and still has a very good chance to be the best.

Now, here’s my 5 (in random order)

- Steph Curry

- Kawhi Leonard

- Kevin Durant

- Giannis Antetokounmpo

- James Harden

This is assuming they are all healthy of course.

For Steph, his gravity and how he shaped the league really gives a lasting impression on him. The great thing is he can back it up through his unbelievable performance. When stars shoot lights out 3 for a game, it will always be compared to Curry because he does it on a nightly basis.

For Kawhi, he’s probably the scariest player to face right now. I watched how he carried the Clippers effortlessly in the Mavs series. He’s closest to how dominant Lebron was during his prime

For KD, we’ve been robbed of 35ppg KD because you already know. The Nets series just proved he can carry any team in the playoffs

For Giannis, I think it’s his inconsistency and his glaring weakness that don’t put him in this list. In this finals, he’s proven he can and if he continues his dominant performance, it’s an easy lock

For Harden, I’ve watched how he carried Rockets throughout the years. Yes he has not yet put up James Harden series which pretty much excludes him from other’s list. However, he’s looking like the best player of the Nets when he was healthy. That shows a lot

Outside the 5, we still have Luka, Jokic, Embiid who when healthy can make a case on their own as well",t3_oipbqy,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/oipbqy/is_it_now_safe_to_say_lebron_isnt_a_top_5_player/,0,92,t1_h4wqknk,2021-12-07 4:28:05 AM,lmao,7,0,0,1,0.5994,10

They don't do college hoops any more (at least I don't think they do) but any games on NBC Sports Network were not a good production. 2. Gallagher Iba is an iconic arena with a lot of good history and fun games in its past, but the way it's built makes the cameras way too high for my preference in tv viewing. 3. I'll watch just about any two teams play as long as it's competitive. So for worst matchup I'll say Kentucky vs Chaminade. 4. There are calls that get missed in every game, but overall the officiating is still very good in D1 basketball. I don't really care who is wearing the stripes. 5. Nantz is very good at what he does but his style is too laid back for me. For color commentary, I'd like to avoid Jay Bilas and his ""I'm smarter than you, therefore my opinion should count more"" attitude. 6.

CollegeBasketball,dragonice81,NIL could be the best possible thing for College Basketball,2021-01-07 6:27:17 AM,"Since the NBA changed their draft eligibility rules in 2006 college basketball has been ruled by the one-and-done stars. From Kevin Durant to Zion Williamson, the sport has become enraptured with players who are essentially biding their time waiting for their opportunity for a paycheck. I don't think anyone is going to claim that a player like KD or Zion would have stayed in college for longer if they were getting paid, but there's a whole other class of player that I think will weigh that decision very differently. 

Examine a player like Dayton's Obi Toppin. He burst onto the scene as a freshman and quickly ascended to stardom. The loss of the 2020 Tournament will forever remain the great what-if for Dayton fans, but what if Toppin could have cashed in on his NPOY season and stayed in college another season or two? Would be be talking about Dayton's Final Four run in the 2021 Tournament? Maybe that's worth more to him than being drafted eighth overall by the Knicks. 

NIL presents an option for star college players to stay in college without having to choose between millions of dollars and absolutely nothing. Sure, one-and-done isn't going away unless the NBA changes their rules, but I do think that giving players the option to cash in on college stardom may incentivize longer stints at the college level. And that is a very good thing for college basketball fans.",t3_obltts,https://www.reddit.com/r/CollegeBasketball/comments/obltts/nil_could_be_the_best_possible_thing_for_college/,112,99,t1_h3or36t,2021-01-07 7:37:49 AM,NBA should allow kids to go straight from HS.

CollegeBasketball,Armadillo_Dildo,"Interactive ""Power Projection"" Map",2021-09-07 9:27:11 AM,"I love checking up on the imperialism maps / the ""remaining undefeated teams"" maps throughout the season, so I've been working on my own version for the coming 2021-22 season: the [CBB ""Power Projection"" Map](https://imgur.com/urkj2Pg) (currently using the latest data from the end of the 2021 season).

In this map, each US county is assigned an ""owner"" based on who has the highest power projection score in that county. This score is calculated for each team in each county by taking their Kenpom Adj. EM and dividing it by the distance between the team's stadium and the nearest county border -- the result is that each county is controlled by the strongest nearby team, allowing teams to expand and protect their ""domain"" by playing better (and thus raising their Adj. EM throughout the season). In order to avoid making it too cluttered, I also imposed a rule that only the top 30 teams (by Adj. EM) could own land; this is pretty arbitrary though so if you think it should be different let me know. 

You can explore the map (and see which non-landed teams are within each team's domain) using this interactive version I made:

> https://werdna63.shinyapps.io/ncaa-maps/#section-power-projection-map

(It should work on mobile, but it's probably going to look a lot better on a desktop / laptop)

It also includes a data viewing tool that lets you view the total land area, water area, population, etc. of each team's ""domain"" (you can even export the tables to a .CSV or a .PDF!). It should update automatically after each game since it draws the data directly from Kenpom.com too!

I'm posting this here now because I wanted to see if anyone had any feedback / recommendations for how I could improve this before the season starts; I also might throw something similar together for college football since that's coming up even sooner.

nbadiscussion,XenaRen,Using Simmons as a way to get off the Tobias Harris contract,2021-22-06 5:35:13 PM,"Ok, so it's pretty obvious at this point that Simmons is gonna be traded. Morey's been wanting to do this ever since he arrived in Philly but after that loss to Atlanta, the general consensus seems to be that his value has dropped significantly - to the point where CJ McCollum may be the best return they can get. A trio of Embiid, McCollum and Harris would be pretty good but ultimately it won't be enough to beat a healthy Nets team or a rejuvenated Lakers. 

As an alternative, what if the Sixers add Tobias Harris to a potential Simmons trade and get a lesser return but clear up enough cap space to go after any one (or two) of the marquee free agents in 2022? Harden, KD, Curry, Beal, Butler, Kawhi, Kyrie and LaVine could all be in that class, depending on what some of them do with their player options. It'd be insanely risky since Philly could very well wind up with none of them on their team, which would most certainly lead to an Embiid trade demand down the road, but the payoff would be immense. 

To be perfectly clear, this is not at all a commentary on Harris. He was pretty good for the Sixers all throughout the playoffs but his contract is just too large for someone who, at his peak, is the third best player on a championship team. A potential Simmons trade presents a good opportunity for the Sixers to move off of that.",t3_o61g8x,https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/o61g8x/using_simmons_as_a_way_to_get_off_the_tobias/,2,12,t1_h2pr20k,2021-22-06 5:43:08 PM,The problem is who are you going to get back. Simmons and Harris combine for like 60 million dollars and you have to wonder whether or not the players you get back will be better than those two. This is why it's tricky because you can't afford to fuck around and waste another season since Embiid's health is always a factor and he's a free agent in 2023.,14,0.091,0.76,0.149,0.6652,6.49
nbadiscussion,RichHomi3Saquon,Ben Simmons to the Brooklyn Nets (and why it makes too much sense),2021-27-06 8:37:10 PM,"I know, I know. It sounds crazy, but there is a scenario where the Nets and the Sixers both come out as huge winners in this trade!

I’ll outline the deal here:

**Nets receive:**

Ben Simmons

**Sixers receive:**

Spencer Dinwiddie (sign and trade, 4 yr $17 mil per)

Joe Harris

2021 1st round pick

2028 1st round pick

#How the Nets Win

The Nets have 3 all time scorers. They need defense. Ben Simmons is an elite 1-5 defender who can also distribute if necessary. On offense, Ben can play in the dunker spot and chill. On defense, he can go all out and be Draymond Green on steroids.

Very easy win.

#How the Sixers Win

The Sixers need two things really badly. They need to surround Embiid with shooters, and they need a primary ball handler who can shoot. Dinwiddie can easily be their primary ball handler and can feed Embiid in the post. That’s all they need, plus, Dinwiddie is a stud scorer in my eyes. Not elite, but in this scenario, we’re trying to commit 110% to helping Embiid lead the Sixers to a championship.

Joe Harris is a bonafide sniper. He can hit threes consistently and would instantly be their best shooter.

Even if you don’t think that’s enough, the two first round picks should get it to about even in my eyes.

#Overall

Neither team takes on or frees up any salary cap, so there is no financial struggle with this trade. This trade is a win-win all around. If I’m Sean Marks or Daryl Morey, I am trying to bang out this deal as soon as possible. It improves both teams by a lot.

They know that if you tune in for the start at 9pm you’ll watch to the end and it’s not their problem that you’re up late. They know if they say 9pm and start at 920 they can show you more ads. Therefore it’s optimal to put the games on Tu/Thu/one of Sat/Sun to maximize 18-34yo viewers that command ad premium. There are 2 days off between games not 3. Everyone agrees that 4 games in 7 days is a lot for players so why would they do that and lose revenue at the same time? They want discussion and hype, optimal viewing dates for ads, and players want the days off for a better on court product.",1,0.034,0.821,0.145,0.9638,2.95
nbadiscussion,2001hardknocks,The NBA needs to re-think and re-format the scheduling of the NBA Finals!,2021-08-07 6:13:56 AM,"Being on the East Coast, having the NBA Finals begin at 9pm every night is quite annoying and highly inconvenient. But I get why the NBA does it. They want to be fair to both Coasts and give viewers on both sides a fair chance of catching the game. That's fine. That's something they have to do. Get the primetime viewers across the country. 

BUT WHY THE HECK do they have 3 days scheduled between games for each of Game 3, 4, 5 and 6. That's ludicrous! I can't see the point in doing that. It unnecessarily prolongs the Finals by a week or more, if the series goes 6 or 7 games. It's just so dumb.

Personally speaking that much gap kills the momentum of the series. As a neutral fan, I lose interest and/or forget the storylines because so much else can fill up the space between games.

Is there a reason the NBA does this? Has there ever been an official reasoning?",t3_og6y9v,https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/og6y9v/the_nba_needs_to_rethink_and_reformat_the/,1,8,t1_h4h3t2m,2021-08-07 7:07:50 AM,"Most likely it keeps people talking about the NBA for longer.

nbadiscussion,Desmondo110,A comparison of FTA per 36 in the Regular Season vs. Post Season 2015 - 2021,2021-01-07 9:22:03 AM,"The NBA announced that it would be changing the rules to help curb some of the unnatural motion that players use to game the rules and draw fouls. The announcement specifically called out Trae Young and James Harden, but this could also be applied to many other foul baiters, like Joel Embiid, Chris Paul, and Kevin Durant. During the post season, it is not uncommon to see these master baiters complain to the refs after not getting a call that they may have gotten dozens of times in the regular season or earlier rounds of the playoffs. Are these players actually getting fewer fouls called for them in the post season compared to the regular season?
I wanted to determine if the players are actually getting fewer fouls in the post season. Using Basketball Reference player statistics for the regular season and post season dating back to 2015, I tried to accomplish just that. To take out any bias that might be created by small sample sizes, I removed any player-season, where the player played fewer than 500 regular season minutes and fewer than 80 post season minutes. I then calculated the number of FTA per 36 minutes in the regular season and the post season for each player-year. I then created a scatter plot with the X-axis as regular season FTA per 36 and Y-axis of post season FTA per 36. If players were getting fouled at the same rate in the regular season as the post season, a linear regression would have a slope of 1, so I added this ideal line to the chart in black. I also added the actual linear regression line to the chart, which can be seen below in blue:
&#x200B;
https://preview.redd.it/mt7s5l2efm871.png?width=561&format=png&auto=webp&s=830325af553aa1fa5bf2b8ec534417fff4474301
The linear regression model has slope of 0.91 and an intercept of 0.23, which indicates that a theoretical player who draws zero fouls per 36 in the regular season would draw .23 fouls per 36 in the post season. On the flip side, a player that leads the league in fouls drawn in the regular season would have the biggest drop in FTA in the playoffs. This can be seen by how the blue linear regression line clearly starts to deviate away from the ideal line at around 5 FTA per 36. It appears as if players that draw few fouls in the regular season are being rewarded with additional FTA in the post season and players that drew more fouls in the regular season are being punished with fewer FTA in the playoffs. This effect is likely the result of a combination of factors: defenders learning more of the offensive players foul baiting tricks over the course of a 7 game series and refs changing how they ref in the post season, and ""letting the players play."" It begs to the question if refs should ref the same way in the regular season and post season?
Some fun statistical nuggets from this analysis:
* In 2017 Dewayne Dedmon shot nearly 12 FTs per 36 in the playoffs after shooting 2.5 in the regular season. He made just over half of them.
* In 2020 Joel Embiid shot the highest number of FTs per 36 in the last 6 seasons, 14.6 because the Boston Celtics tried to defend him Daniel Theis and Enes Kanter. The Celtics still swept the series.
* Of the top 10 highest FTA per 36 in the regular season, Giannis in 2021 has the worst ratio of post season to regular season free throw attempts. 10.4 FTA/36 in the regular season compared to 7.8 FTA/36 in the post season.",t3_obpavr,https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/obpavr/a_comparison_of_fta_per_36_in_the_regular_season/,17,6,t1_h3pcyex,2021-01-07 10:20:06 AM,"This was super interesting. I wonder if poor free throw shooters being intentionally fouled contributes to the increase in free-throws for players who don't take a lot. I haven't done any real thorough research but quick glancing at Basketball reference revealed that some of the worst ft shooters in modern history i could think of, Drummond, DJ and Simmons all saw increases in attempts. Also that outlier at around 10 ft attempts who goes up to around 15, is that Jimmy?",3,0.089,0.818,0.093,-0.3818,2.43
nbadiscussion,krs196,Stars that may be traded that may be surprising.,2021-09-07 2:44:45 PM,"This summer, with the free agency market lacking big time, it seems likely most teams will try to improve via the draft or trade.
And while this draft has some legit star talent at the top you may see one or two teams trade a older star to get, most will try to get a star from a trade.
I was working out who may be available, including people we may not expect. We have all heard about maybe Simmons or Lillard and Beal seems like he'll be an option, at least in people's heads, so if any of them got traded it really wouldn't be too surprising.
So the question became: **Is there anyone who has an actual possible shot of being traded (i.e. not Doncic nonsense trades) that may not be someone people expect but - in a market that may see teams bidding against each other and thus, driving up prices on talent - could still be dealt?**
Here's a list of people I think qualify for this:
- **KAT**
**Why yes**: The Wolves have been/are perpetually kind of a mess. I'm not sure where I'd rank KAT in the NBA, atm, but I can see a team talking themselves into his potential to improve (whether its there or not). The Wolves may decide to truly blow everything up and shed salary as they try to sell the team. Also, with all that's happened in his life during the pandemic, he may just want a change of scenery.
**Why no**: He may like the low-key nature of Minny, and with all that has happened in his life, he may enjoy playing with his friend D-Lo more than leaving for somewhere else. Also, while a lot of new owners like blowing things up, KAT is still young enough to be a building block.
**Possible teams**:
**Knicks** - They have Mitch, but I think KAT has more potential and it would allow him to be closer to his hometown. It could be a move for the Knicks where they get someone with star potential without having to give up the farm.
**Jazz** - Jazz don't usually make flashy moves, but I think him and Gobert could coexist without getting in each other's way too much. KAT may like playing PF too and the Jazz could provide some franchise stability. It'd be a bit of an old-school lineup but sometimes going against the grain can surprise teams. Engles could be flexed where needed as well.
**Washington** - The Wizards thinking they are closer to conention than they are and deciding to keep everyone AND deciding to give up way too much for KAT wouldn't even register as surprising to me.
- **Jrue Holiday**
**Why yes**: While Jrue did well for them, if they don't like how the Finals go down and can package him in a deal for a better player, they may go for it.
**Why no**: He has played well for them during the season, and the Bucks would likely make a coaching change before overhauling big parts of the roster. Also, sunk cost fallacy.
**Possible teams**:
**Blazers** - This would be an improvement. Blazers could take him on as part of a package and figure to trade him later or try to contend still now. Lillard with Giannis and Middleton would be scary, but issue is what else can Bucks give at this point in a trade?
**Depth** - I'm putting this here to encompass a number of possibilities with the basic idea being that maybe they can get 3 players that, while none are as good as Jrue, together they can help the team more.
- **Chris Paul**
**Why yes**: The Suns may end up winning the title, but Chris isn't getting younger and if some team wants to throw $100 mil.+ at him, the Suns may be appreciative of his help but not stupid.
With Booker, Bridges, Ayton, the Suns will be contenders still in the future, especially if they can get a decent haul. With a sign and trade, Paul could go to a team he wants, even if they don't have the cap room to get him in free agency.
Sarver may not want to pay high-dollar for their core 4.
**Why no**: Umm, the Suns are two games from the their first Finals victory ever. It's easy to assume the Suns young talent will continue to improve, but it's not always a given, and so why screw things up now?
**Possible teams**:
**Knicks** - He's expressed desire to play their before and he could really help them make a deeper playoff push. If he's willing to take a 3 yr deal for say 90 mil., and the Knicks don't have to give up more than a couple of assets, I could see this being possible for them.
**Bucks** - Remember what I said about the Jrue improvement? This could be a way to improve with the limited assets Bucks still have.
**Lakers** - I don't think the Lakers can be ruled out this off-season from big moves, and it wouldn't surprise me if Paul hits that sweet spot of they have enough to get him/him being a big help for the team.
Though, it's possible the Suns don't want to help a title rival, they may also recognize that rival would be built in part around some admittedly older stars.
- **Siakam**
**Why yes**: This goes back to what I said at the start; while the Raptors may not be inclined to trade him, if enough teams want to get stupid about it, they may decide he has platued and it's worth it to trade him while they can get so much.
**Why no**: It may just be he's better as a 2nd star and the Raptors like the core they have and want to build with him still, because again, despite any narratives atm, he's really good.
**Possible teams**:
**Warriors** - We've seen the rumored offer, but it really depends on how much the Raptors like Wiseman.
**Mavs** - I could see Dallas sending 4 firsts or more and Kristaps to get him in the type of move other contenders have made for stars. Would it be the right move for them? Ehhh, maybe?
While Kemba, Kristaps, McCollum all may be traded, they aren't on the level of the others above.
One team to watch out for: **The Hawks**.
The Hawks are ready to take the leap but are superstar hunting at this point, and have the assets to do so. I think they wait though until next off-season and see if the situations with Embiid, Giannis, or Doncic implode first before making all-in move.

I think they’re probably trying hard to get Simmons with DLo but if he is traded it has to be a blockbuster trade almost AD like. With the injuries and his lack of support, people have forgotten how good he is but I think nearly every team would want to trade for him if he is available. 2) They put like 4/5 picks for Jrue, they aren’t trading him but he just hasn’t got it going offensively. CJ could be an interesting fit as they do need a more offensive playmaker but with his contract it’s not really a positive contract where they can get back great depth too. 3) CP3 is a Free Agent and he’s going to chase the money which he rightfully should. Suns would be stupid to let him go and I think they’ll give him that and they’ll run it back. CP3 would be great with Middleton/Giannis but Suns aren’t taking on Jrue. Lakers have no chance of CP3 even Lowry and I’m a Lakers fan. 4). Siakam is in that FVV/Boucher timeline, I don’t see why Raptors would trade him unless for a young potential superstar. Dallas have time on their side with Luka has to be a calculated play and I don’t think Siakam moves the needle enough to sacrifice that many assets",12,0.101,0.705,0.194,0.9792,5.94

In my opinion, it could go either way. Siakam is a cornerstone of the team and has many great years ahead of him. But this trade could be a possible power move for the team. They could end up like the 87’ Bulls ( Getting Scottie Pippen and Horace Grant in the same draft ) and have a bright future as a team with two very talented players, as well as James Wiseman, who also has a lot of potential as a player. 

Personally though, I do think they should play it safe. I’m a little biased since Siakam is my favourite player on the Raptors, but he is currently one of the best players on the team. I also don’t think the 4th pick will have an immediate impact on the team, so they’ll probably get another high draft pick next year.",t3_odw2nc,https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/odw2nc/whats_your_thoughts_on_the_rumoured_siakam_trade/,517,432,t1_h44qcfu,2021-05-07 7:24:44 AM,"I think if the Raptors are sure Kyle Lowry is leaving, it could make sense to start a rebuild.

The Jazz won't even commit to developing two really good power forward prospects in Juwan Morgan and Jarrell Brantley.

nbadiscussion,warboner65,Adam Silver and kowtowing to the players: when will it end?,2021-03-07 3:47:49 PM,"Adam Silver is by all accounts very pro- ""player power."" He clearly wants to be seen as a friend of the players, and he's particularly careful not to offend star players.

This approach is by and large lauded by NBA media, which identifies with players over and above the the league or regular NBA fans (it also has a tendency to view these issues through a political lens, and suggest that anti-player-power attitudes are the product of some sort of racism). 

There are dissenting voices in the media though. One obvious example is Bill Simmons. Though he *used* to be in favour of Silver's ""the players are always right"" attitude, of late he's done a 180 (correctly imo). You'll hear Russillo and him actually provide pushback and stress, essentially, that ""something must be done.""

My question is: **will something be done?** For those of us who think Silver is WAY too much of an overcorrection from Stern, **will we ever get to the point where someone's going to put their foot down and address some of the player-power related problems (we all know what they are) in the league?**

nbadiscussion,Guwop25,[OC] How the Bucks slowed down Trae Young in Game 2,2021-26-06 4:57:42 AM,"I've been writing tons of NBA articles recently, so here's a film breakdown I did on the defense played against Trae in Game 2. Hope you can get something out of it.

EDIT: Removed the 2nd video because it wasn't a great example.
***
Trae Young has been having a historic playoff run that reached its peak in Game 1 where he had a career night with 48 points. The Bucks were able to slow Young down in Game 2 to even the series at one apiece. Young had just 15 points on 6/16 shooting, 1/8 from three, and had 9 turnovers. Let's take a look at how he was brought back down to earth.

Young has been abusing the drop coverage in the pick and roll all postseason, attacking the slow-footed center and either letting his patented floater go or tossing the lob to his roll man, most often Clint Capela. 

Here, Giannis Antetokounmpo's length prevents Young from getting the floater up so Brook Lopez can stay back a little more to cover Capela, Jrue Holiday is also there behind Lopez to ensure there isn't an opportunity for the lob. Because of Holiday's soft double team on Capela, Lopez doesn't have to worry about guarding Trae and Capela at the same time, so he's right there to get the block on Young's layup attempt.

Trae runs the pick and roll with John Collins and Lopez again plays drop coverage but thanks to Giannis coming over to help on Collins, Lopez doesn't have to worry about the lob threat and can focus mostly on preventing Trae's floater. He gets a great contest on it and the shot is off.

Holiday once again is aggressive on defense, picking Young up at half court. This lack of aggression in Game 1 is what allowed Young to go off. Holiday does make a bad decision in reaching around Trae's back for the steal, allowing him to get free temporarily and into the mid-range. With PJ Tucker and Giannis on the block to help, he had no driving lane and was forced into a tough mid-range shot over the outstretched arm of Lopez. Young actually missed Collins, who was open in the corner.

Young tries to run the pick and roll with Capela, Holiday goes over the screen, Giannis drops off of Kevin Huerter to take away Capela as a lob threat, Khris Middleton comes over to trap Young and take away any potential shot attempt. He gets stuck in the air and loses it out of bounds.

VIDEO: https://streamable.com/pr7erj


Holiday comes over the screen tightly and Young tries to draw the foul, but as he realises that Holiday is way too far away for the referee's to call it, he's forced to pass it while in mid air and it goes straight to Tucker. Holiday gets out on the other end for the easy two points.

VIDEO: https://streamable.com/2ujuad

This is just poor decision making from Trae. An off balance lob pass from the logo where Tucker was right behind Collins and Lopez was in perfect position to jump in front of it and intercept it. I don't know what read Trae saw because there was never a chance of this working out. It was most likely out of frustration as the Bucks got out on a run.

VIDEO: https://streamable.com/2khufa

Here is a fantastic read from Middleton. He sees Bogdan Bogdanovic coming off the down screen set by Danilo Gallinari and knew Young was going to hit him for the open three, but he jumps the passing lane and gets out for two points on the other end.

VIDEO: https://streamable.com/mpb1tf

Trae is hounded by Holiday coming off of the high screen, Trae tries the bounce pass into Collins at the free throw line but Holiday's quick hands allows him to pick it off. Even if the pass got through, the possession likely still would've resulted in a turnover as Collins would've been in a tight spot with Middleton, Holiday, and Lopez all right there.

Another high screen and roll with Collins. Tucker comes in to block the lane for Collins to roll, forcing him to pop out to the three-point line. Middleton does a great job of helping and putting pressure on Young. Trae looks up to the rim to see if he can get a shot off, but Lopez is right up in his grill. He sees Collins open for three at the top, but Holiday's lightning-quick rotation gets Trae stuck in the air, where he throws it straight to Tucker. This is a perfect example of needing a whole team to slow down the opposing star. 4 players played a crucial part in forcing the turnover here. I think this is the best defensive possession on Young through this entire postseason.

The Bucks did a fantastic job with their aggression, forcing him into sloppy turnovers and tough jump shots.


All post-season, Trae has been punishing teams for playing drop coverage. But the Bucks played it a little differently tonight. They were using extra defenders on the pick and roll coverage, so as not to leave Lopez vulnerable, having to guard Capela and Young at the same time, which is what happened in Game 1 and both the Knicks and 76ers series. They were making sure they always had an extra defender there to take away the lob threat or the floater threat, leaving Trae with just one option instead of two. Lopez would also play up higher on the pick and roll, often coming out to the free throw line instead of dropping all the way back to the restricted area like he did in Game 1.


They made it a priority to trap Trae, putting him in the tightest spaces possible and because Trae is a small guard, it was a struggle for him to make the pass out of it despite his superb playmaking abilities.


If the Bucks can keep trapping Young, forcing him into making tough passes and keep playing good help defense with drop coverage, then they should be confident about their ability to keep Trae Young at bay and win this series.",t3_o89ewr,https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/o89ewr/oc_how_the_bucks_slowed_down_trae_young_in_game_2/,611,69,t1_h36l6ee,2021-26-06 10:08:10 PM,"OP i have one question, were do you find those nba advance stats clips ? i was searching in [nba.com](https://nba.com) but couldn't find them. thanks. good oc",1,0.107,0.76,0.133,0.1879,2.83

I think we can look at his closest archetype of player historically, Magic Johnson. Magic was not the athlete Simmons is, he wasn’t going to jump over guys consistently, it was also a pretty well known fact that Magic couldn’t shoot. He was better than Simmons, but still not good. The big difference is Magic could score in a plethora of other ways. He was a good finisher (Simmons is not), he had a passable post game, which is elite for a guard (Simmons does not), and he wasn’t timid, quite the opposite. Magic wants to make the big play, Simmons does not. Honestly, if Simmons never learns to shoot, which is highly probable, but works on finishing, and develops some go to post moves, he’s a matchup nightmare. He strong, athletic, and has long arms. I think that’s a more viable route for him as a player than magically developing a jumper in one year, erasing muscle memory he’s built his whole life.

nbadiscussion,FormerKarmaKing,Bucks vs Hawks Game 3 Analysis: Predictions & Things to Watch For,2021-27-06 1:25:58 PM,"After the Bucks outmatched the Hawks in game 2 at Milwaukee, both teams are looking to make game 3 a deciding factor on how the series will play out. Here is some analysis on how tonight’s game might go in Atlanta.

The Bucks have seemed figure out how to fluster the Hawks on defense. They put pressure on Trae by eliminating his space off the PnR and helping off of the perimeter. This was a key adjustment from game 1 where Milwaukee looked to stay home and let Trae beat them off of high-percentage floater looks.

Atlanta has to get really creative on offense, and they need great production from either of their secondary scoring options (Huerter or Bogi). If Milwaukee continues to help off the perimeter (which they will), Huerter or Bogi should look to be aggressive scorers in order to make the Bucks pay.

Keep in mind, the result of Atlanta’s misses were primarily due to the Bucks defense rather than variance. To combat this, Atlanta should look to fix their spacing issues with the John Collins and Clint Capella pairing. Capella isn’t a shooter, so a Trae/JC PnR isn’t an effective game plan since Capella’s defender is gonna help in the paint. They can try to rely on the Trae/Capella PnR, but Milwaukee is going to continue to sell out and help off of JC. I expect Collins to put up a bunch of threes today.

Offensively, the Bucks still don’t have much to worry about. Maybe Atlanta can try the wall, but they have attempted this and their wall is effective with defenders Bogi and Gallo. Their perimeter defenders weren’t aggressive enough in cutting off Giannis’s driving lanes. If they are more aggressive, however, the Bucks should resort to putting Giannis in screener situations and open up scoring opportunities for Jrue/Middleton as ball handlers.

Milwaukee probably will not shoot as efficiently as they did in game 2. However, they did not sway the game from the shooting; it was the defense and Giannis being aggressive in the paint. Also, they lost by 40 points, that tells you they were outmatched on both sides of the ball.

I expect the Bucks to continue the aggressive help on Trae, which will open up opportunities for Atlanta’s wings. He should become more of a willing passer out of the PnR, and their wings will have more production offensively - the only question is if they can score at an efficient rate. Collins will attempt more three point shots since Giannis tends to help off of him.

Overall, my prediction is the Bucks win somewhere around 10-15, with another big game from Jrue and Middleton getting into a groove.

nbadiscussion,HenryGrosmont,5 biggest playoff stock risers,2021-08-07 8:33:03 AM,"Hey everyone! I’ve been writing a lot of my basketball takes recently, so hopefully u guys like this article! The 5 Biggest Stock Risers During These NBA Playoffs
The NBA is interesting because during the regular season, fans and media members overreact to players’ performances and form their “player rankings”, only for the playoffs to come around and completely dismantle the aforementioned ranking system. I say this to make the point that when we TRULY think about who the best players in the world are, we need to more heavily consider what they do in May, June and July as opposed to what they do when half of the teams are load managing. For example, take a guy like Julius Randle. He made 3rd team all-NBA (as he should have) because he had a remarkable regular season, leading a Knicks team that played their hearts out in all 72 of their games and earned a 4 seed in the competitive Eastern Conference. However, when the playoff came around and the intensity was heightened, Randle didn’t look like himself. He couldn’t overpower people in the paint anymore, he didn’t create as much space to shoot his mid-range, and he didn’t shoot the ball well from anywhere on the court. Randle is a great player, but he’s not a top 15 NBA player yet - not even close - and it’s because of what he’s done (or hasn’t done) in the most important games that an NBA player can play. Playoff games. Note: When ranking the biggest playoff stock risers, I’m considering two main components: 1) How much better the player performs in the playoffs as opposed to the regular season and 2) How much more recognition a player gets during the playoffs as opposed to during the regular season (most often a result of a certain team not playing many nationally televised games or not playing in a big market, among other reasons).
5) Kevin Huerter
Kevin Huerter’s rise is definitely a testament in part to the 2nd ranking criteria; he plays in a small market (ATL) and is an unassuming, young player who was drafted in the same draft as Trae Young (and therefore has been overshadowed in the early part of his career). However, this man can flat out BALL, and it’s been a pleasure to watch him flourish in these playoffs. First of all, he’s 6 foot 7 and a good athlete. Yes, a good athlete. He gets super high on his jump shot, and it allows him to EASILY get shots up on shorter players, both out of the post and in the pick and roll; if you didn’t get a chance to watch ATL-PHI game 7, check out Huerter’s highlights from that game in which he absolutely exposes the Sixers (specifically Seth Curry) in the mid-range. He doesn’t just have the pull-up in his bag, though, he also has an underrated handle which allows him to get to multiple different spots on the court. We’ve seen him defended by some of the best defenders in the league during these playoffs (Jrue Holiday and Ben Simmons) and still be able to handle the rock under pressure and physicality. The ability to get to spots in the mid range and rise up to hit shots consistently is something that’s sustainable to build an offensive game around (we’ve seen guys like Beal, Booker, Durant, Middleton, and MANY OTHERS do it already), and Huerter is in an excellent position to do it as well, especially considering he’s only 22 years old. Huerter has also shown a solid ability to make plays for others. He has a high level understanding of offense and is always decisive and confident in his moves and passes, allowing him to be a secondary playmaker for the Hawks during this postseason. If you diligently watched the Hawks this postseason, you’ve probably seen a few of his cross court, lefty passes off the dribble. That’s high level stuff. Finally, Huerter plays on BOTH ENDS of the court! He’s shown some incredible fight while having to defend the likes of Tobias Harris, Ben Simmons, Jrue Holiday, Khris Middleton, and many other talented offensive players. He’s just a really good athlete with long arms who plays his butt off on that end and isn’t afraid to be physical and put his body on the line. 4) Cameron Payne Cam Payne’s first claim to fame in the NBA was for his pregame dance routines with Russell Westbrook. Also, he was literally playing in China 2 years ago, and on multiple D-League teams before that, so it’s safe to say he definitely wasn’t on the average NBA fan’s radar prior to this postseason. He’s had an unbelievable turnaround, though, and he is about to get absolutely paid when he becomes a free agent next season. Payne has this special bounce in his step that I haven’t really seen before; he looks like he could be shot out of a cannon at any point and glide his way to the hoop. He’s also got a really nice floater game around the basket, and he can finish athletically with both hands and with control of his body at the rim. He pairs this with fantastic vision and a 6 foot 7 (!) wingspan, which makes him an unbelievable offensive threat. Before game 6 of the WCF (where CP3 assured all doubters that he is indeed the point God), there was a very persuasive case to be made that Cam Payne had been more effective than Chris Paul against LAC. This is because when CP3 was out of the lineup due to Covid, Payne took his game to a whole new level. We saw a confidence and comfortability that we hadn’t seen before with him, probably because he finally got the start and played big, important minutes. I had thought that maybe he would lose that bounce in his step over the course of a 48 minutes game if he was tasked with playing starting point guard minutes. Perhaps, I had thought, he was only that energetic because he comes in for 6 minute bursts. Well, I was dead wrong. Payne was as spry as he’s looked throughout these entire playoffs in games 1 and 2 of the WCF against LAC, and it has most definitely earned him a starting point guard spot in his near future, whether it be with Phoenix or another team. He’s going to get offered big money from an organization in free agency, much like Terry Rozier was offered a massive contract by the Hornets after his huge playoff performance with the Celtics in their 2018 playoff run to the conference finals. Payne has proven himself to be an impact player who deserves a firm spot in an NBA starting lineup, as well as a much larger contract than his current one (2 years, $2.1mil). The days of Cam Payne being “the guy who dances” are over, and he’s here to stay. He’ll be dancing ON the court from now on... 3) Dillon Brooks
I must admit that I’m definitely considering the play-in games in conjunction with the playoff games when ranking these players, whether that’s logical or not. But guess what? I’m writing the article, so there’s unfortunately nothing you can do about it, unless you’d like to leave me a nasty comment at the bottom of this article. If Brooks and the Grizzlies had somehow found a way to surpass the Jazz, and Brooks had continued playing the way he was, there’s a very real possibility that Brooks would have been number one on this list. The Dillon Brooks that we saw in both the play-ins and the play-offs is a two way STUD that we didn’t have the pleasure of witnessing during the regular season nearly enough due to him playing in Memphis and therefore being overshadowed by both Ja and Jonas, not to mention playing in a small market. He’s got one of the better motors I’ve seen in the NBA, and it allows him to be a pest on defense like not many others can. He guards the best player on the other team in virtually every game MEM plays, and he WANTS IT, too. He loves the competition, he loves getting in your grill and making you miserable for 94 feet, and he loves being physical. In other words, his game (specifically on the defensive end) is tailor-made to the playoffs. On the offensive end, Brooks showed unbelievable strides in his skillset during the playoffs. He’s 6 foot 7 and 225 pounds, and he’s got a surprisingly polished offensive game. Like Huerter, he has a solid handle and can get to his spots in the mid-range and just rise up, which allows him to shoot over defenders with ease. He’s a lot stronger going to the hoop than Huerter, though, and he’s got a real knack for finishing around the rim with a number of different push-type shots with both hands. Finally, he can hit the three point shot, which forces defenses to guard him on the perimeter, therefore opening up room for Brooks to attack the paint. If Brooks continues his development on the offensive end, I really think he can turn into one of the best two-way players in the NBA. He averaged 25.8 points in this postseason against a very solid Jazz defense, and there’s no question he’s already one of the toughest perimeter defenders to go up against in the league. He’s only going to continue to improve, and he’s a name that you’re going to hear in the all-star conversation next year.
2) Trae Young
If you had any gripe with Trae Young being considered a superstar before the playoffs, you can no longer have that gripe. I mean, you can, you would just be very wrong. Trae Young has a few offensive qualities that, when paired together, make him virtually impossible to stop. The first thing he has is a great shooting touch from range; you can’t leave him with a step, or else he’ll get his three off quickly and will kill you. This forces defenses to pick him up basically as soon as he walks over halfcourt (much like Curry or Lillard), and it forces them to go over screens as well. The second thing that Trae possesses is an unbelievable first step - probably the best in basketball. His change of speed and ability to burst by the defense is second to none in the NBA, and when paired with his ability to shoot, it allows him to drive with incredible ease; he had the 3rd most drives per game in the entire NBA this season, which is pretty remarkable for a scrawny guy like Trae. Trae also has the best floater game in the NBA (by far). He takes and makes the most floaters in the league, and he doesn’t really need any space or time to get it off, which makes it quite lethal. He’s also the best lob thrower in the NBA; his lob (the majority of the time to either Capela or Collins) looks exactly like his floater, too, so it makes the Hawks virtually impossible to defend once Trae gets in the painted area. When Trae throws the ball in the air, the defense is afraid to block it (because if it’s a floater, it could be called for goaltending), and that oftentimes results in an easy dunk for one of the athletic ATL front court players. When combining these three qualities (shooting touch, quick first step, and lethal floater/lob game), it makes Trae dominant offensively. It doesn’t end there, though. Trae has that killer instinct, which I think many people were surprised by; people thought that once the pressure intensified as it does during the playoffs, Trae would have a hard time dealing with it. Instead, however, Trae used the defenses’ over-aggression to his advantage, blowing by the defense and either getting fouled or getting to his floater/lob game. He talked trash to opposing players, opposing fans, and literally anyone who was willing to listen to him. Against PHI, not only did he play against one of the meanest fanbases in the league, but he was defended primarily by Ben Simmons and Matisse Thybulle, two incredibly tough and physical PLAYOFF defenders. He wasn’t phased in the slightest, and it was unbelievably fun to watch. Trae put the entire ATL team on his back throughout the entire playoffs, and he’s proven that he must be considered a top 5 NBA point guard.

It was very satisfying to watch as a fan of the game itself, and the power of a collective team instead of what in the NBA usually comes down to the power of a few superstar individuals. And of course they completed a redemption arc after losing in 2013, and it was TD's swan song, etc. So they are a beloved team. But they weren't dominant. The 2015 Warriors are a brutal matchup for them. I think that squad was as deep, if not deeper than the Spurs. People tend to forget how good they were on defense, particularly at the wing. They could adjust to anything. And of course they had a great offense that was an anomaly that no one really knew how to deal with. Even with thier beautiful game, I don't think the Spurs could keep up. Warriors in 7.",1,0.071,0.763,0.167,0.9542,3.17

Because I genuinely believe that 2014 spurs team could defend any recent dynasty besides warriors with kd, which I even think would go to a 5-6 game win to warriors. I also think they could defend even one of the later bulls teams in the 90s.

The 2014 spurs had a better bench than 2015 warriors imo and had defenders that could slow down their guards. 2015 warriors mimicked the 2014 spurs passing, but it wasnt as good as the 2014 spurs.

I think the 2014 NBA Finals against a Heat team that frankly wasn't that good has caused people to have inflated opinions on that Spurs team. In 2014, the Spurs were taken to 7 games in the first round by the 2014 Mavs, and got taken to OT in Game 6 against OKC. And system wise, I actually think the 2015 Warriors in Kerr's offense was a better version of 2014 Pop's—as it involves some triangle principles too",1,0.045,0.802,0.153,0.8932,3.03

**Ben Has Little Value.**

Ben Simmons' trade value plummeted during the course of the 2021 playoffs. The best trade package that the 76ers could possibly get in return for Ben Simmons right now is CJ McCollum and Robert Covington, and a lineup of that nature simply isn't going to get them anywhere near contending status. I pulled up a few of the trade offers that I found off B/R's ""Expert"" Trade packages: [https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2944844-br-nba-expert-trade-packages-for-philadelphia-76ers-star-ben-simmons](https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2944844-br-nba-expert-trade-packages-for-philadelphia-76ers-star-ben-simmons) You could read the article for a full analysis but I don't want to make my thread long.

*Simmons for CJ McCollum*

*Simmons for Buddy Hield, Marvin Bagley*

*Simmons for Kemba Walker*

*Simmons for D'Angelo Russel*

*Simmons to the Mavs, Kristaps to the Rockets, John Wall to the 76ers*

These are all hypothetical trades, but you can clearly see this guy isn't worth that much right now. None of the pieces you would acquire in any of these trades put the 76ers in championship contention.

**Joel Embiid Has A Lot Of Value And Is Very Injury Prone**

Embiid is coming off the best season of his career, where he just finished second in MVP voting and likely would've won the award if he played a full season. That is where the problem lies. A guy with Embiid's injury history, size, and weight is NEVER going to play a full season. I don't care what anyone says, this guy has been injured far too often and his injuries are NEVER going to get better. His value is only going to go down as the 76ers championship aspirations dwindle even farther.

With two years left on his deal, the 76ers could get an amazing trade package for him. I would assume that it would be a better deal than the one the Pelicans got for Anthony Davis since Embiid hasn't requested a trade so there isn't an impending need to trade him like there is for Ben Simmons.

If you don't believe me about the injury stuff, you can look at Anthony Davis and tell me how that worked out for the Lakers this year. And FYI, its going to be worse for Joel Embiid because hes 7'0 270lbs. Trading him right now would be the best thing for the franchise in the immediate future.

**The Big Three Doesn't Fit Together**

There is no point in trying to make Simmons, Embiid, and Harris work together. It just doesn't work.

You have to treat Simmons like a big and when you look at how the team is presently constructed, they are never going to win with two starting bigs. Simply put, Joel Embiid does not fit well at all with Ben Simmons and neither of them fit in a three way with Tobias Harris. They're all below average three point shooters in today's NBA.

Embiid: 37.7%

Tobias: 39.4%

Simmons: ... we don't have to do that to him

Though they did surround the team with role players that can shoot, it just seems like this team can't get anything done because its 3 stars are below average shooters.

**For Simmons To Be Successful, You Have To Build A Team Around Him**

Its been 4 years so the thought that Simmons is magically going to develop a jump shot is nonsense. He can get better at free throws and even if he is able to get to at least 70% (very doable if he works on just that), he can be an incredibly serviceable player. All he needs to work to get better for now is the free throw line and definitely develop a midrange game.

Knowing this, you have to surround the team with pieces that revolve around Simmons' skillset. Similar to how Milwaukee is building around Giannis Antetokounmpo, the 76ers have to build the team with Simmons' shooting woes in mind.

As for what these pieces might be, this is the part that I struggled with but thats why the Sixers hired Daryl Morey.

**Ben Simmons, The Player**

Here are a few Ben Simmons physical profile stats that would be great to keep in mind:

**Height**: 6'10

**Weight**: 250

**Wingspan**: 7'0

**Strengths**: Elite Passing Vision, Defensive Versatility, Defensive IQ, Interior Presence, Ability to guard 1-5, Elite ability to playmake and put the ball on the floor, basically everything that doesn't involve shooting

**Weaknesses**: Shooting

*His only weakness is shooting. That's something you can fix.*

You can't teach 6'10, 250lbs with the ability to put the ball on the floor the way that Simmons can. People don't understand, this guy is a physical freak of nature. Embiid is a freak of nature, but Simmons is legitimately a physical phenom. He does everything almost perfectly, except shoot the damn ball.

You can teach someone to be a decent shooter, but you can never teach someone to be 6'10 250lbs.

**Summary**

Embiid is really injury prone and likely will leave with amazing trade value so it is best to act on a trade this offseason which involves moving Joel Embiid. Simmons has terrible trade value so there really isn't a point to move him because the team won't get better. Build the team around Simmons with the assets you can get in return for Joel Embiid. A general manager like Daryl Morey won't have a problem figuring this out. One of the best basketball minds in the league. Also Tobias harris has an unmovable contract so your best bet is just to figure out how to work Simmons and Harris.

With that said, there are some holes in your argument. Embiid and Harris both shoot higher than the league average: 36.7%. The difference between Giannis and Ben is scoring though. Giannis can score at will most often, Ben cannot. Having a weakness as big as his is rough: you can't trust him on the floor right now at the end of games, he is way too much of a liability at the line. Maybe he can improve his FT% but he's a career 60% from the line in the Regular season and 52% in the Playoffs. That is an awful stat combined with not being able to score and being paid ~$36million dollars for the next 4 years. I agree that Embiid's injury history raises concerns, but I don't think the Lakers would trade a healthy AD this year for what they won last year. Simmons is too expensive to be this bad at shooting.",2,0.113,0.79,0.097,-0.4161,2.97

Joel like AD might be injury prone but they hold value cause are MVP caliber players when healthy. They are phenomenal all around talents. Ben is a gamble. If he continues do underperform he will literally be untradeable consuming massive cap space. Second, Ben won’t be a PF or C overnight. He is far from that and is undersized enough to even out his lack of skill. Giannis has freakish athleticism that allows him to change position, yet he also lacks basic post skills. Come playoff time they can’t play that position overnight, it needs time. Third, no team trades an MVP caliber player against his will that played well in playoffs. It either receives a bunch of many good players, meaning constructing a new team or swapping superstars which is practically impossible and will probably be a downgrade. Also, this team loses respect to every superstar free agent. It has never happened for a reason. That said, if Ben stays philly fans will riot.

Simply put, Joel Embiid does not fit well at all with Ben Simmons and neither of them fit in a three way with Tobias Harris. They're all below average three point shooters in today's NBA.

Embiid: 37.7%

Tobias: 39.4%

Simmons: ... we don't have to do that to him

Though they did surround the team with role players that can shoot, it just seems like this team can't get anything done because its 3 stars are below average shooters.

**For Simmons To Be Successful, You Have To Build A Team Around Him**

Its been 4 years so the thought that Simmons is magically going to develop a jump shot is nonsense. He can get better at free throws and even if he is able to get to at least 70% (very doable if he works on just that), he can be an incredibly serviceable player. All he needs to work to get better for now is the free throw line and definitely develop a midrange game.

Knowing this, you have to surround the team with pieces that revolve around Simmons' skillset. Similar to how Milwaukee is building around Giannis Antetokounmpo, the 76ers have to build the team with Simmons' shooting woes in mind.

As for what these pieces might be, this is the part that I struggled with but thats why the Sixers hired Daryl Morey.

**Ben Simmons, The Player**

Here are a few Ben Simmons physical profile stats that would be great to keep in mind:

**Height**: 6'10

**Weight**: 250

**Wingspan**: 7'0

**Strengths**: Elite Passing Vision, Defensive Versatility, Defensive IQ, Interior Presence, Ability to guard 1-5, Elite ability to playmake and put the ball on the floor, basically everything that doesn't involve shooting

**Weaknesses**: Shooting

*His only weakness is shooting. That's something you can fix.*

You can't teach 6'10, 250lbs with the ability to put the ball on the floor the way that Simmons can. People don't understand, this guy is a physical freak of nature. Embiid is a freak of nature, but Simmons is legitimately a physical phenom. He does everything almost perfectly, except shoot the damn ball.

You can teach someone to be a decent shooter, but you can never teach someone to be 6'10 250lbs.

**Summary**

Embiid is really injury prone and likely will leave with amazing trade value so it is best to act on a trade this offseason which involves moving Joel Embiid. Simmons has terrible trade value so there really isn't a point to move him because the team won't get better. Build the team around Simmons with the assets you can get in return for Joel Embiid. A general manager like Daryl Morey won't have a problem figuring this out. One of the best basketball minds in the league. Also Tobias harris has an unmovable contract so your best bet is just to figure out how to work Simmons and Harris.

*I will be referring to this later on in my analysis*.

**Ben Has Little Value.**

Ben Simmons' trade value plummeted during the course of the 2021 playoffs. The best trade package that the 76ers could possibly get in return for Ben Simmons right now is CJ McCollum and Robert Covington, and a lineup of that nature simply isn't going to get them anywhere near contending status. I pulled up a few of the trade offers that I found off B/R's ""Expert"" Trade packages: [https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2944844-br-nba-expert-trade-packages-for-philadelphia-76ers-star-ben-simmons](https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2944844-br-nba-expert-trade-packages-for-philadelphia-76ers-star-ben-simmons) You could read the article for a full analysis but I don't want to make my thread long.

*Simmons for CJ McCollum*

*Simmons for Buddy Hield, Marvin Bagley*

*Simmons for Kemba Walker*

*Simmons for D'Angelo Russel*

*Simmons to the Mavs, Kristaps to the Rockets, John Wall to the 76ers*

These are all hypothetical trades, but you can clearly see this guy isn't worth that much right now. None of the pieces you would acquire in any of these trades put the 76ers in championship contention.

**Joel Embiid Has A Lot Of Value And Is Very Injury Prone**

Embiid is coming off the best season of his career, where he just finished second in MVP voting and likely would've won the award if he played a full season. That is where the problem lies. A guy with Embiid's injury history, size, and weight is NEVER going to play a full season. I don't care what anyone says, this guy has been injured far too often and his injuries are NEVER going to get better. His value is only going to go down as the 76ers championship aspirations dwindle even farther.

With two years left on his deal, the 76ers could get an amazing trade package for him. I would assume that it would be a better deal than the one the Pelicans got for Anthony Davis since Embiid hasn't requested a trade so there isn't an impending need to trade him like there is for Ben Simmons.

If you don't believe me about the injury stuff, you can look at Anthony Davis and tell me how that worked out for the Lakers this year. And FYI, its going to be worse for Joel Embiid because hes 7'0 270lbs. Trading him right now would be the best thing for the franchise in the immediate future.

You want someone who's not a big as the superstar coming back in the deal. Options (in principle) as I see them, point is that they're implausible and/or bad: TL;DR some half interesting stuff and a bunch of memes at the end. Embiid for Lillard + more, maybe Covington and maybe even Nurkic (maybe the most plausible one to me, except the Sixers have to make up salary) Embiid for KAT and D'lo (I know I said not a big but KAT can actually shoot) (compared to the rest I'm thinking of, relatively plausible, you'll see) Embiid for Bradley Beal + more (puts Russ with Embiid, also why would the Wizards try to go with what the Sixers just failed with with an older and less defensively versatile, although not offensively incapacitated Westbrook with a much worse supporting cast?) Embiid for Bam Adebayo, Tyler Herro, and maybe more (maybe if the Tyler Herro situation deteriorates and they really want him out, but they would have better options than giving up Bam, even if it meant getting Embiid) Embiid for AD (if AD weren't handpicked by LeBron maybe possible but doesn't solve the injuries problem, and AD while a big can shoot, and AD was handpicked by LeBron so not happening) Embiid for Brandon Ingram, Josh Hart, and Lonzo Ball (Not solving the injuries problem, salaries are an issue) Embiid for Paul George and a bit more (could change a lot depending on how PG13 plays in the rest of the playoffs, also only will happen if Kawhi wants it since PG13 is there at his pleasure) Embiid for Gobert + picks (bad deal for the Sixers, doesn't solve the problems you were talking about, but at least the Jazz would take it if offered, tells you how crazy the rest of these ""options"" are gonna be) Embiid for Khris Middleton and Jrue Holiday (never going to happen, salaries are way off already and the Bucks would never do this it's just insane) Embiid and Harris for Middleton, Holiday, and Lopez (likewise insane) Embiid+a lot of salary filler they don't have for Brogdon, LeVert, and Turner (doesn't make the team better anyway) Embiid for Tatum and Brown (never going to happen because Celtics would be losing too much control and as we saw with Kemba are being conscientious of injury-proneness, and salary issues) Embiid for (sign-and-trade) DeRozan, assorted Spurs guards and maybe Keldon Johnson as a backup (no way, DeRozan isn't a 3-point shooter so it doesn't solve the problem, also might not agree to the sign-and-trade) Embiid for Julius Randle, straight up (lol jk I'm a Knicks fan and I love Julius Randle, bonus offer Embiid for Theo Pinson) Embiid for Jokic (no, I'm a Jokic hater anyway because the way I see it, he can never win a playoff series against a good offensive big because he's so terrible at defense, even if he is trying now. Against AD he would pick up 3 fouls early, sit a lot because of it until the fourth, then pick up 2 more fouls and either just not play defense or foul out. Embiid for KD, Harden, or Kyrie (no way the Nets do this) Embiid for CP3 (no way the Suns do this, also CP3 could just opt out if you do this before the season so may as well wait to see if Simmons improves his shot enough to make a difference next season) Embiid for Trae Young and more (no way the Hawks do this Embiid for all of the Mavs except Luka (then the Sixers would have Simmons and Porzingis as a ""guard"" who can't play guard and a ""forward"" who can't play forward, so it'd be funny oh yeah and btw we're not even pretending to care about salaries anymore) Embiid for whoever is on the Magic now (lol) Embiid for Christian Wood and Kevin Porter Jr (r/nba might go for it lol) Embiid for Siakam and more (doesn't make the Sixers better) Embiid for Vucevic and Lavine (probably doesn't make the Sixers better) Embiid for who on the Grizzlies? anyone? Embiid for De'Aaron Fox/Buddy Hield (let's not be mean to Joel and send him to Sacramento without one of those players, and doesn't make the Sixers better) Embiid for no one on the Warriors because their image of paying and keeping their championship core is important to them beyond short-term results, and the Sixers will not be helped by Wiggins and/or Oubre Embiid for Kevin Love and Cedi Osman (no) Embiid for Kemba (injury concerns are the reason to trade Embiid, OKC would have to throw in SGA but they're not going to do that, and Presti does not get to feed his pick fetish) Embiid to the an expansion team in Seattle (sorry Seattle fans, I'll stop getting your hopes up) Embiid to the Hornets for the entire team that won't improve the Sixers' situation",1,0.081,0.799,0.12,0.9909,2.7

Though they did surround the team with role players that can shoot, it just seems like this team can't get anything done because its 3 stars are below average shooters.

Its been 4 years so the thought that Simmons is magically going to develop a jump shot is nonsense. He can get better at free throws and even if he is able to get to at least 70% (very doable if he works on just that), he can be an incredibly serviceable player.

Here are a few Ben Simmons physical profile stats that would be great to keep in mind:

**Height**: 6'10

**Weight**: 250

**Wingspan**: 7'0

**Strengths**: Elite Passing Vision, Defensive Versatility, Defensive IQ, Interior Presence, Ability to guard 1-5, Elite ability to playmake and put the ball on the floor, basically everything that doesn't involve shooting

**Weaknesses**: Shooting

*His only weakness is shooting. That's something you can fix.*

You can't teach 6'10, 250lbs with the ability to put the ball on the floor the way that Simmons can. People don't understand, this guy is a physical freak of nature. Embiid is a freak of nature, but Simmons is legitimately a physical phenom. He does everything almost perfectly, except shoot the damn ball.

You can teach someone to be a decent shooter, but you can never teach someone to be 6'10 250lbs.

Why do you believe this? I'm not saying they should be title favorites, but this seems like a team with a legit shot of a title. Philly's a very good team *right now*; Simmons imploded offensively and they were still just a couple of possessions from the ECF. McCollum and Covington is a pretty good combo of players as long as you aren't asking them to play outside of their long-time roles. Philly is right on the cusp, and it's mostly because of Embiid. He had some struggles but, ultimately, he played like a star in that Hawks series and gave them a chance to win. You don't get rid of the guy who is the biggest reason you're a good team in the first place. >Joel Embiid Has A Lot Of Value And Is Very Injury Prone Yes on the injury prone part, but even with his knee issues he was still a beast in these playoffs. And trading a star almost never nets you a truly fair return. The Pels got a huge haul for AD, and two years later they are still an 11th seed.

Whether it’s his stubborn adjustments, the lack of preparation come playoff time, or his teams always falling short, it happens under his auspices too often. 

So question is, why was he so highly regarded out of San Antonio to get the Atlanta and Milwaukee jobs, if it turns out he’s actually not as good as people thought? How does he sell owners and GMs that he’s the best coach for the job? What’s the speciality about him? 

I realize he came to Atlanta and improved them drastically in the regular season. Same with the Bucks, but until now they hadn’t hit the ceiling (and you could argue the Nets injuries allowed it more than anything).

So you'd still have Kobe/Shaq Lakers from 05-08ish. If we're talking about a scenario where Shaq did stay fit but still fueded with Kobe and ended up getting traded to the Heat.... I honestly don't see too much of a difference given his advanced age by that time. They had a 3-2 lead on the Pistons in 05, but Wade being injured in game 6 kind of screwed them over. Maybe if Shaq was slightly more fit, and dominated the Pistons more they could've beat them to advanced to the finals? That would've been his best chance for another ring outside of his Lakers rings IMO. He'd win one in 06, that's a given. He was injured for half of the 07 season, I guess you could argue that he wouldn't have gotten injured had he been more fit. But Wade was also missing 30 games, perhaps a healthier Shaq could carry them to 50 wins in the regular season and maybe past the 1st round in the playoffs. But Wade was clearly off that year, so they probably won't make it far with Wade not at 100% Wade was injured again in 08, the Heat probably still trades Shaq since he's 35 now. He'd probably still suck with the Suns since they play a COMPLETELY different style and he's just not a good fit at 35 years old no matter how good of a shape his body is in.

nbadiscussion,Bienfuuuuu,Making sense of this Devin Booker statistic.,2021-23-06 7:54:00 AM,"All of the analysis done here is through NBA Math’s TPA Model (model explanation: https://nbamath.com/tpa-model/). This is an accumulation stat, therefore the more minutes a player logs, the higher their TPA should be.

For the last few years, I’ve been following this NBA Math TPA model because it seems to be an extremely effective indicator of player added value. For example, these are the 2021 Regular Season TPA results: https://nbamath.com/2020-21-nba-tpa/ 

You’ll find the league MVP atop this list, and also the other two finalists in the top 10 along with the usual suspects in the MVP race. You’ll also notice there aren’t really any outliers. Most of the top 20 are players that made the all-star game and make up the all-NBA teams. According to this statistic, the top 40 NBA players have a season TPA over 100. 

Great. So what’s this issue?

I think that most rational NBA fans would have Devin Booker AT LEAST in their list of top 40 players. Right? Obviously. However, on this list, he ranks 201st with a total TPA of -4.60. He is bookended by players named Cameron Oliver and Devin Cannady. The only players around him that have played remotely the same amount of minutes (2,270) are Donte DiVincenzo and Daniel Theis.

Okay so maybe he just didn’t have a great regular season? But as someone that has watched every Suns playoff game, I know he’s having a great playoffs. 

Taking a look at the playoff TPA rankings, Devin Booker is currently ranked 36th of ALL players that made the playoffs (including players eliminated after round 1). His has played 484 minutes and has a TPA of 14.33. This puts him behind 5 of his teammates, but also behind Marc Gasol, who played 87 minutes and accrued a TPA of 18.19.

Whenever what I see on the court doesn’t seem to match stats, I think the stat tends to be flawed. But this is a stat I’ve watched for multiple years now and in my opinion, is a great indicator of value. 

As someone who has loved watching the Suns this postseason, and especially Booker, how do you make sense of this statistic? Is Booker really not all that valuable? And what is the flaw/disconnect the stat has with the game?

Playoff TPA: https://nbamath.com/2021-nba-postseason-tpa/",t3_o6ef4y,https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/o6ef4y/making_sense_of_this_devin_booker_statistic/,2,8,t1_h2s3ksq,2021-23-06 8:57:32 AM,"Of course the stat is flawed. OPA is derived from OBPM. And in my view, OBPM is heavily dependent on role and usage within an offense, and efficiency. Devin Booker had a simply solid year in terms of scoring (though i think he was scorching it earlier in the season). But his assists are down. Why? Because of the addition of CP3. His OBPM is also down as a result, therefore his OPA is down. You'll find that his OBPM was better in previous seasons because he had a heavier playmaking role. Booker is much more relegated to a finishing role within the Suns offense, the recipient of set plays as opposed as the initiator. Much like Deandre Ayton, who is primarily a finisher of plays as opposed to the initiator, he also has a similar OPA and lower OBPM. Cameron Payne, who plays a heavy facilitating role within the Suns offense, has as good OPA. Now, this TPA model accounts for defense as well, and so its no secret that Booker isn't a good defender so that's going to hurt. His DBPM doesn't look too good either. If we want to look at Donovan Mitchell for comparison, he had a good regular season, but in the playoffs, his OBPM and of course TPA went through the roof because of his extremely hot 3 point shooting. So in order for Booker to have a higher TPA, he would need to take upwards of 30 shots per game, he'd need to be much more efficient from 3, and he'd have to shoulder a larger playmaking burden in the absence of CP3. None of these have anything to do with ""Oh he's not that good, or he is that good."" It's all role and usage. So then you have to ask what value does Booker add? And what would theoretically happen if he was replaced by someone else? Booker is a very good playmaker, but Cameron Payne and CP3 have those responsibilities before him. In the absence of one of those guys, Booker is able to step up into the point guard role without any issue. The value added is in his versatility, but of course, this is not captured in this stat. Let us say that Booker is off the court. As we saw in Game 2, Cameron Payne played a very good game, but at the same time, the Clippers defended Payne much better even though his numbers were much better. The Clippers sagged a little bit off of Payne and did not commit to hard doubles which didn't let Payne get as many passes to Ayton as he was doing in game 1. Payne, for the most part, did the next best thing and that was attacking the rim and into the shot blocker. This failed when Zubac wasn't on the court, but this is the desirable outcome that the Clippers want. If Booker is not on the court, even though Payne was more efficient, he would be coaxed more into shots that the Clippers want to defend as he would be the sole ball handler. Booker adds spacing and a very deadly scoring threat just by being present on the floor, and his gravity allows Payne to attack the rim with more ease. This is not captured in TPA, however. In fact, floor spacing is not even a factor at all in these advanced stats. Elite shooters such as Reddick and Korver have very pedestrian OBPM (therefore OPA), but you can not deny the fact their spacing provides immense value and impact to an offense. At the end of the day, do not doubt Booker. He is a superstar because he is both an elite scorer and fantastic playmaker. He dissects an offense in ways only superstars are meant to do. Despite the fact that his advanced stats do not look anywhere near as good as Mitchell, he has a much superior skillset, and it makes all the difference as to why the Suns have a 2-0 lead over the Clippers without needing to depend on ridiculous 3 point shooting (as opposed to the Jazz and Mavericks). When Booker is on the floor and has the ball, it's very very hard to force him into a bad possession even if he's missing more shots, when the same can not be said for Mitchell, who shot 44% from 2 against the Clippers and turned the ball over whenever he tried to make a pass to Gobert. Tldr: TPA views him as a high volume scorer on slightly above average efficiency, poor defense, and mediocre to subpar playmaking. This characterization of Booker is obviously incorrect as he is one of the absolute best scorers in the game and is a fantastic playmaker, but because TPA is derived from OBPM, Booker's reduced role with the addition of CP3 and the emergence of Cameron Payne makes his advanced numbers look a lot worse, almost akin to role players",1,0.074,0.8,0.125,0.9922,2.75
nbadiscussion,Blue_bell88,How did the 8th seeded Grizzlies beat the 1st seeded Spurs in the WCFR of the 2011 Playoffs,2021-02-07 3:41:12 AM,"This upset by the Grizzlies is something most fans have either never remembered happening, never heard of before, or just completely forgotten about it. The San Antonio Spurs were the no.1 seed in the 2010-11 season boasting a record of 61-21, good for the 2nd best record in the league. Meanwhile the Grizzlies were the 8th seed with a record of 46-26. In the First Round the Grizzlies beat the Spurs in 6 games. When i first discovered this, i was perplexed that almost no one had ever mentioned this happening before. You always hear about the ""We believe Warriors"" beating the Mavericks in 2007 yet this had never come up before. So I went to check if maybe the spurs had injuries to the Big Three and found that every player on the team played all 6 games of the series except for Manu who missed out on only 1 game, so injuries weren't the reason why this loss was excused. I have 2 questions about this.

1. To the fans who remember this happening, that either watched the games or know a bit more about this upset, how did the Grizzlies beat the Spurs? 
2. How did the Spurs and especially Tim Duncan/Tony Parker get away with this? If Kobe, Jordan, Lebron, Magic, Kareem, Durant, Curry, Harden EVER lost to an 8th seed in the first round, their legacies would be PERMANENTLY destroyed. This would be brought up on every discussion about them and would never escape their legacies. Yet I'm willing to bet 95% of fans here either don't know this happened or don't care.

Zach Randolph and Gasol just bullied and controlled the paint so well. Tony Allen was a really good defensive wing and the way they slowed the game down was infuriating for an opposing team trying to get any kind of rhythm going. I'd be surprised to see if any of the winning scores were above 110 and maybe even 100. Theyd run the clock to like 5 or 3 before getting up a post up shot. True team basketball and great defense.,6,0.097,0.611,0.291,0.9715,4.41
nbadiscussion,TyrannosaurusGod,How did the 8th seeded Grizzlies beat the 1st seeded Spurs in the WCFR of the 2011 Playoffs,2021-02-07 3:41:12 AM,"This upset by the Grizzlies is something most fans have either never remembered happening, never heard of before, or just completely forgotten about it. The San Antonio Spurs were the no.1 seed in the 2010-11 season boasting a record of 61-21, good for the 2nd best record in the league. Meanwhile the Grizzlies were the 8th seed with a record of 46-26. In the First Round the Grizzlies beat the Spurs in 6 games. When i first discovered this, i was perplexed that almost no one had ever mentioned this happening before. You always hear about the ""We believe Warriors"" beating the Mavericks in 2007 yet this had never come up before. So I went to check if maybe the spurs had injuries to the Big Three and found that every player on the team played all 6 games of the series except for Manu who missed out on only 1 game, so injuries weren't the reason why this loss was excused. I have 2 questions about this.

1. To the fans who remember this happening, that either watched the games or know a bit more about this upset, how did the Grizzlies beat the Spurs?

As to how it happened, the Grizzlies matched up really well, gained confidence, and had a young team with tons of energy. Spurs were aging a bit and the young pieces (George Hill, Tiago Splitter) weren’t big factor. In my opinion, the biggest issue was the Spurs were so thin at big that year, so Duncan was beaten up banging with Gasol and Randolph every game. And Randolph was a monster in the post late in games. On the perimeter, Conley and Allen were defensive stoppers able to keep Parker and Nobli from getting whatever they wanted. They played tough D all series and capitalized.",16,0.06,0.82,0.12,0.7328,2.7
