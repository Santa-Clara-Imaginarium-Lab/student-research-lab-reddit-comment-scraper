You don't have to be the MVP to be a respectable player (and for others to enjoy playing with you). As long as you play safely, participate (i.e., don't slack on defense), use good sportsmanship, and don't call BS fouls, you'll probably do great. Going into the games (and as you watch other pickup games), you might think a little bit about spacing on the court. It's important on both offense and defense. On offense, try not to clutter other players, especially the player with the ball (unless you have a reason, like setting a pick). On defense, spacing (relative to your ""man"") is about finding a sweet spot: if you're too far away, you make it easy to do things (like score), but if you're too close, you make it harder for *you* to do things (like stop a drive).  You'll get a feel for these things as you play. IMO, that's the only way to learn them, since they're so dependent on your athleticism and responsiveness.",2,0.063,0.715,0.222,0.988,4.720000000000001

"Basketball","Economy-Assistant-69","What if there is a 4 point line?","2021-08-07 3:07:36 PM","Let's consider this basketball variant. Use the high school 3 point line for 3 pointers. As for the 4 point line, rather than a arc,  draw a straight line from one end of the side of the court to the other side passing the top of the NBA 3 pointer line as the centerpoint. Any shot behind it be worth 4 points.

"Basketball","KingswillRise02","What if there is a 4 point line?","2021-08-07 3:07:36 PM","Let's consider this basketball variant. Use the high school 3 point line for 3 pointers. As for the 4 point line, rather than a arc,  draw a straight line from one end of the side of the court to the other side passing the top of the NBA 3 pointer line as the centerpoint. Any shot behind it be worth 4 points.

Clearly Maria was a diversity hire because I said so, and that kind of white genocide needs to be called out whenever it can.  Saying that someone was only given a position because of their race is perfectly fine.  In fact, based on several studies that I will not link here because they might not actually exist, diversity hires are less productive than everyone else and are literally the leading cause of AIDS.  In conclusion, saying that someone was brought on as a diversity hire is not only fine but correct, and everyone should say it.

Early to mid 2000s football (soccer) was characterised by tactful defence, which I think made the star players appear better than they perhaps were relative to this era, followed by an offensive explosion such as Pep Guardiola’s Barcelona. Tennis saw this as well with Federer’s proactive serve and volley style, in combination with an elite all around game, preceded by Novak Djokovic’s more reactive you’re gonna have to try your absolute hardest on every point to beat me given I can return everything. 

How do you see the defensive response to the space and pace era of basketball evolving over the next few years? I think it is not in doubt that in this current era of basketball, the elite offensives of teams far surpasses the defence. Will this come in the form of perhaps a change to spacing through rule changes e.g. changing the 3 point line to eliminate corners 3s. Or perhaps this is not a large concern given the variability seen in 3 point shooting, particularly in the playoffs. How do you see the next evolution in defensive organisation in the NBA that could catalyse a more defensive era seen in the 2000s and then possibly what offensive strategies could be implemented to then counter this?","t3_odaunv","https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/odaunv/reactive_basketball_to_the_space_and_pace_era/",24,6,"t1_h400eyd","2021-03-07 11:50:34 PM","I agree that this pattern occurs in many sports but tennis is not a good example. In the 80s almost every player served and vollied but as time went on the racquet technology allowed players to hit the ball harder and with more control. Nowadays it is not a viable strategy as players cannot cover enough ground to deal with the precision of players hitting from the baseline. I feel like this change was more due to technology than a strategy revolution like the other sports.  I think the only thing the NBA can do is the rule changes they were discussing to stop offensive players from running/jumping into defenders. I definitely would like to see a return of some more physical defense. The offensive game has progressed so much and with so many shooters on the court, it is way harder to stop stars nowadays.

"nbadiscussion","Hurricanemasta","The obvious Ben Simmons trade","2021-24-06 2:27:48 PM","With the recent [reports](https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2944958-report-nets-brass-was-upset-with-kyrie-irving-gm-would-listen-to-trade-offers) of the Nets front office possibly being open to discussing trading Kyrie Irving this offseason, I think the obvious deal is Ben Simmons for Kyrie - straight up.  The salaries basically match up (Simmons actually makes a few million less than Kyrie), which is probably the major roadblock for most trade ideas for Ben Simmons.  Moreover, this swap would give each team exactly what they want/need.

Nets: They address their greatest weakness - defense, with an All-Defensive first teamer.  I am personally of the opinion that Ben Simmons should switch to center, or at least the frontcourt, where his defense will continue to have massive impact and his shooting woes will be minimized.  Playing with two of the most talented scorers of the generation, if not ever, Simmons can stand in the dunker's spot all day and not ruin the offensive structure as Kevin Durant and James Harden do their damage from the midrange and long range, and he's there as a vertical spacer.  Plus, maybe he can pick up some tips from Durant and Harden and evolve back into a useful offensive player with a more reliable free throw.  All of this fails to mention that when Harden goes out, you replace him with an All-NBA player at point guard, and Ben Simmons durability shames Kyrie's.

Sixers: Shooting and iso offense - exactly what they need.  With Kyrie's excellent marksmanship, Embiid can permanently park himself inside and finally eschew shooting 3's, something he's verbally stated he dislikes.  When Embiid goes out, the Sixers will still be able to put points on the board with one of the league's best iso players and scorers.  Is Kyrie a defensive downgrade?  Sure, but the Sixers still have an All-Defense player in Matisse Thybulle - just give him a few more minutes (25-ish?) to paper over the deficit.  Plus the offensive upgrade from Simmons to Kyrie should make it a net positive even with more time on the court for a weak offensive player like Thybulle.

And best of all, we the fans get two more complete championship contenders that boost the East further on to the level of the Western contenders.  Everybody wins!","t3_o7aely","https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/o7aely/the_obvious_ben_simmons_trade/",4,22,"t1_h2zunko","2021-25-06 6:55:49 AM","I've been watching the NBA long enough to know that its history is littered with ""coulda woulda shoulda"", so for me, the idea that the Nets are so good when healthy that they should fairly easily cruise to a title next year if healthy simply doesn't hold water.  Could the Sonics have won in '96 if they'd put Payton on Jordan earlier in the series?  Would the Lakers have beaten the Pistons in '89 if Magic hadn't gotten injured?  Should the '11 Heatles - with three Hall of Famers - have handled the Mavs with ease? Do I believe this trade is realistic?  Of course not.  Most of the trades discussed on reddit are not.  Philly is going to struggle mightily finding any trading partner for Ben Simmons, and Kyrie has enough connections with the Nets to supersede any inclination Sean Marks may have to ""listen to offers"". My basic assertions are these - Kyrie fits wonderfully on the Sixers, Ben Simmons fits wonderfully on the Nets, both teams get demonstrably better, and the salaries match.  If the GMs of these two teams were HurricaneMarks and DarrylMasta, I would pull the trigger on this so fast your head would spin. Personally, I believe that running it back is only a real strategy for a young team who lacks cohesion, and even then it's a strategy to get better, not win a title.  NBA teams need to push the envelope every year just to keep up, and you don't have to look very far in the past to see instances where it paid off.  Could the Raptors have simply run it back in '19 with their 59-win team?  Would the Warriors have been just as well off keeping Harrison Barnes after a season in which they won 73?  Should the '18 Nets continue to develop their young core in the hopes of climbing the Eastern ranks? After the 2012 finals, everyone thought the Thunder would be the next dynasty, and they they were destined for at least a handful of titles, but things happen.  They ran it back again and again without making moves to become demonstrably better and they never sniffed the finals again. For my imagination, this is an interesting and plausible deal, and I'd tune in to the Sixers and Nets much more frequently than I do now because they'd both be more complete teams without redundant or deeply flawed for their system's players.

"nbadiscussion","addictivesign","What is the future of the Clippers?","2021-27-06 11:05:25 PM","They’re currently down 3-1 in the WCF to the Suns in a series where they’re more than likely to lose. They have an aging and injury prone Kawhi Leonard who has mysterious handlings of his injuries and doesn’t seem like much of a team leader. They have Paul George who has been better at times this postseason, but has also still come up short at times where the moment needs him to come through. It seems like another wasted year in the Paul George-Kawhi Leonard era. 

A few things going for them: Terance Mann is developing into a fine-caliber role player. Reggie Jackson is playing some of his best basketball ever. Tyronn Lue is proving to be an upgrade at head coach over Doc Rivers. They seem to be a more resilient team than we’re used to. 

But they’re a team capped out and low on realistic flexibility going forward. Kawhi and Ibaka have POs. Jackson and Batum are UFAs this offseason. Most of their best draft capital was given to OKC in the PG trade. Teams such as the Lakers, Warriors, and Nuggets should be healthier in the West next season and will make the Clips path harder. 

I just don’t know what this team looks like in the future. They’re coming up short in their present iteration, and have aging superstars along with tough competition, but also have made some positive steps this season. What should they do going forward? How much longer do you keep the Kawhi-PG duo together?

"nbadiscussion","YelIowmamba","How do you use the postseason vs. the regular season to evaluate players or coaches?","2021-24-06 9:00:52 AM","I've noticed a reasonable discrepancy in the way fans/commentators value players vs. the way they value coaches. For instance, there is a huge group of people that defend players like Westbrook, Giannis and Gobert despite the fact that they have come up short of expectations in the playoffs. Coaches such as Dwane Casey and Budenholzer were both very successful regular season coaches that came up short of expectations in the playoffs and have received almost unanimous disapproval because of their post season struggles. We can't forget that Bud was the coach of the year in 2015 and 2019 both years when he took different teams from mediocre eastern conference teams to 1st seeds.

For instance, there is a huge group of people that defend players like Westbrook, Giannis and Gobert despite the fact that they have come up short of expectations in the playoffs. Coaches such as Dwane Casey and Budenholzer were both very successful regular season coaches that came up short of expectations in the playoffs and have received almost unanimous disapproval because of their post season struggles. We can't forget that Bud was the coach of the year in 2015 and 2019 both years when he took different teams from mediocre eastern conference teams to 1st seeds.

If you get off to a horrific start, that’s enough to make a player or coach change. But if you roll along fine, have to deal with injuries, or stay at least competitive, it’s harder to judge off regular season.  Playoffs are a much more accurate gauge. That’s the moment you get to see coaches under pressure. How do they make adjustments? How do they handle adversity? Can they get the most out of their best players in the big moments when it matters?  Playoff results are much more telling for what a coach actually is. For example, guys like Mike Budenholzer and Doc Rivers have strange rotations that usually get picked apart. Coaches like Ty Lue are shown to be full of adjustments and making minutes count. Coaches like Spo and Pop find a way to get the most out of their players and run good systems when it matters.  So unless the regular season is filled with locker room issues or bad starts, it’s much harder to gauge off of that compared to playoffs.",7,0.081,0.807,0.112,0.4098,6.12

"nbadiscussion","fskier1","How might Shaq's career after 2005 have been different if he had stayed fit and played more?","2021-28-06 2:06:56 AM","**Shaq's career stats (that I will be using for the purposes of this post):**

|Games|Career PPG|Career Points|
|:-|:-|:-|
|1207|23.7|28,596|

&#x200B;

From the 1993 to 2005 Season, Shaq averaged 67 games per Season. **For the first scenario I will do the following:**

1. In the final six Seasons of his career, I’m going to continue to use 67 games each year.
2. Instead of using his points per game as they were, I’m instead going to take a different approach, and decrease his ppg by 1.5ppg each successive Season.

**Scenario One:**

|Season|Age|Games|Career Games|PPG|Career PPG|Points|Career Points|Notes|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Till 2005|20 - 32||882||26.7||23,583||
|2006|33|67|949|21.4|26.4|1454|25,037||
|2007|34|67|1016|19.9|25.9|1333|26,370||
|2008|35|67|1083|18.4|25.5|1233|27,603||
|2009|36|67|1150|16.9|25.0|1133|**28,736**|**Surpassed total career points.**|
|2010|37|67|1217|15.4|24.5|1032|29,770||
|2011|38|67|1284|13.9|23.9|931|30,701||

&#x200B;

**Now I’m going to assume Shaq:**

1. Ends up playing 20 Seasons instead of 19.
2. Plays 70 games per Season for his remaining seven Seasons (after 2005).
3. Decreased his ppg by 1ppg each year instead of 1.5.

**Scenario Two:**

&#x200B;

|Season|Age|Games|Career Games|PPG|Career PPG|Points|Career Points|Notes|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Till 2005|20 - 32||882||26.7||23,583||
|2006|33|70|952|21.9|26.4|1533|25,116||
|2007|34|70|1022|20.9|26.0|1463|26,579||
|2008|35|70|1092|19.9|25.6|1393|27,972||
|2009|36|70|1162|18.9|25.2|1323|29,295|**Surpassed total career points.**|
|2010|37|70|1232|17.9|24.8|1253|30,548||
|2011|38|70|1302|16.9|24.4|1183|31,731|**Would be fourth leading scorer of all time in 2011.**|
|2012|39|70|1372|15.9|23.9|1113|32,844|**Would be third leading scorer of all time in 2012, surpassing Michael Jordan.**|

&#x200B;

There are countless other “what ifs” you could explore with Shaq, but I think I might get more into the realm of fantasy if I tried taking on too much. Maybe somebody with more knowledge here could give something similar a go.","t3_o9ghpl","https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/o9ghpl/how_might_shaqs_career_after_2005_have_been/",27,13,"t1_h3brtf5","2021-28-06 7:58:36 AM","This analysis is ok, but I think it needs a table with his actual stats from these years.

Also, you have to take into account that it’s hard to keep playing for a long time as a very large big.  That’s hard on knees and such.

I think the energy they bring to the table without putting up skull crushing eye popping box score stats has been really fun to watch.

I love his impact on the court and watching his sort of “redemption” playoff run has added an emotional component I very much appreciate. Their have been some other big performances by other role players and George sometimes shoots like shit but his composure and ability to smooth the game out is why this Clippers team was able to come back against the Mavs, Jazz and maybe the Suns.

It allows the coach to waste less time on certain things, and it allows the coach to speak through the veteran rather than to the entire team. It's clearly what the Bucks were lacking for years. Just having Jrue Holiday, who is a veteran playmaker, gives the Bucks way more poise and versatility on offense. I have to wonder, if we were to swap Jrue and CP3, would people still be accusing Bud of being an incompetent coach who can't run an offense?",1,0.081,0.766,0.154,0.826,3.04

I know refs don’t always call all violations-traveling and 3 second rules come to mind. But watching refs hold the ball, ready to go, until Giannis finishes his pantomime free throw practice, and then almost never calling a violation when his shots go over 10 seconds is astonishing to me.  I don’t watch every game, so maybe they have cut others this same slack, but I haven’t seen anything like it in any game I’ve watched this year.  In that sense, the failure of the refs to follow the rule is uniquely benefiting a single team, and is therefore not the same as the laxity in the rules listed above, where they don’t strictly apply the rule even as most teams show violations. That’s a random following of the rule; this allowance for Giannis is a specific act that is repeated multiple times a game.  It also seems like the ref standing and waiting for Giannis to be ready, while everyone else on the court is ready and waiting, constitutes a delay of game. A player or coach would certainly get dinged for that kind of delay, wouldn’t they?  Even a recent nba last 2 minute report listed two 10 sec violations as Incorrect NonCalls. How are the referees allowed to continue exhibiting such bias in favor of only one team in their refusal to follow this rule for this single player?  I’ve seen arguments that they won’t change now because they set precedent throughout the season-that would work if this happened across the board to most teams, but it doesn’t. It is a delay of game, committed willfully and repeatedly by refs, to the benefit of a single player and a single team.  What is the rationale for refs causing a delay of game and exhibiting clear bias with their refusal to enforce this rule?",1,0.099,0.798,0.103,-0.2127,2.5300000000000002

What if Leonard wasn't hurt during the Suns-Clippers series? 

What if, in Game 7, Durant's long two was actually a three?

A lot could have changed if even just one of these ""what if's"" were answered, but my question is what is the BIGGEST ""what if?"" that comes to your mind when you think of the history of the NBA?","t3_odu8ie","https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/odu8ie/biggest_what_if_in_nba_history/",36,54,"t1_h4415f5","2021-05-07 2:02:06 AM","What if Drazen survived or never got into that car accident?

As nba free agency approaches and there are a few examples of players that seem to have good upside, but aren't getting the minutes because that position is stacked for that team, but that are exciting to developing teams. 

Example: The Hawks have Clint Capela and Onyeka Okongwu, and so the management is indicating that they aren't willing to pay out for John Collins, mainly because they know they have to pay a few other players next year. So Collins is probably going to walk. 

What are good examples of undervalued or underutilized players, and then they were traded, or left in free agency, to become all-stars? 

James Harden is the primary example that comes to mind.","t3_ogdeoq","https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/ogdeoq/what_players_went_from_the_bench_to_allstar_with/",8,15,"t1_h4ne7nv","2021-09-07 5:08:01 PM","Paul Westphal - won ring with Celtics as bench player, becomes All-NBA level in Phoenix, even leading the Suns to the Finals against his former team Gerald Wallace (?) - drafted straight out of high school and received no playing time on a contending Kings team.

He played for Portland and was traded to Indiana for Dale Davis.  O'Neal came to the NBA straight from high school (same draft as Kobe) and played his first four years as a Blazer before the trade.  I wrote for Sportsline then and remember writing that O'Neal was an exception to the normal bench player.  Most bench guys can play well for a few minute stretches but then their weaknesses start showing.  O'Neal was a guy whose stats were going to go proportionately to the time he received.  If his minutes doubled his stats would double, if his minutes tripled, his stats would triple.  And that's what they did when he took off to All Star levels with the Pacers.",5,0.026,0.908,0.066,0.2144,2.66

They struggled attacking the basket. Players like Capela and Collins were constantly clogging up the paint. Capela could provide some sort of gap spacing as he normally stands around the dunker spot and he can always punish defenses when they help off him with lops. Yet, the same thing can't be said for Collins with his way below average 3 point shooting. And I do believe John Collins won't have any meaningful role in this team in the future, given how much he struggled getting his shot and attacking the basket and Capela having much bigger of an impact in the role Collins was supposed to play.

&#x200B;

Therefore, I could see a trade happening with Minnesota. I know Towns still has some years in this contract, but his timeline with Minnesota seems unreparable at this point. Edwards seems to be the focus of their future and I don't see a way that team starts contending anywhere in the near future. So there's a chance they cash him out and get some pretty good young talent along side their young core. 

&#x200B;

Karl Anthony Towns and Hernangomez for John Collins Sign and Trade, Clint Capela, Kevin Huerter, Cameron Reddish, the 20th pick in this year's draft, 2021 Swap and a 2022 First

&#x200B;

I think this move really fixes a lot of issues for both teams. The hawks are getting a superstar next to young who can give them extra spacing, allowing their guards and forwards to finish inside. They still can get some defense with Okongwo depending on how he turns out, but he might juts end up being a great back up center for a while.

The Timberwolves are getting  a really good young core to build around with. Collins would fit amazing with Russell and Edwards, Cam Reddish has a lot of potential still and Kevin Huerter would easily be a starting small forward for a possible contention rotation. They still get a lot of assets in return for it with the picks and Clint can easily be traded for a good young package for teams who are looking to start contending and lack big man rotation, aka the Hornets.

I want Chris Paul to win a chip so bad, but man, I can’t say that they’ll win because the Suns were the absolute best, but because they were the healthiest.

These guys are professional athletes that make a living off their physical abilities, their bodies and their minds.

There’s a lot of confirmation bias involved in that rhetoric. If someone who was “supposed” to win does, no one really thinks about it twice. This is one of the biggest problems with judging a player’s legacy on championships—skill gets you in the mix, and luck usually puts you over the edge one way or another. -It’s no coincidence that 2 of the 3 teams left in the playoffs are among the deepest teams in the league right now. Obviously rotations get pared down in the playoffs, but here’s the thing—if you’re counting on a team of 6 or 7 high-end guys to take you all the way through the playoffs, I don’t think you have much of a right to complain when some of your key players get banged up playing 40+ minutes every game and suddenly you’re playing replacement-level players significant minutes. Building out a complete roster is as much a part of being the best team to me as having X number of top-25 guys.",6,0.049,0.844,0.107,0.9022,6.07
